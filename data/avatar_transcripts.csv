Katara,"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.",1.0,1.0

Katara," It's not ""magic"", it's waterbending! And it's ...",1.0,1.0
Sokka," Yeah, yeah, ""an ancient art unique to our culture"", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying  that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.",1.0,1.0

Iroh, I won't get to finish my game?,1.0,1.0

Zuko, That light came from an  incredibly  powerful source!  It has to be him!,1.0,1.0
Iroh," Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.  I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.  Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?",1.0,1.0

Aang," Don't worry, it'll wash out.  So do you guys live around here?",1.0,1.0
Sokka,  Don't  answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light?! He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy!,1.0,1.0
Katara," Oh yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that  evil  look in his eye.  The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.",1.0,1.0

Aang,"Oh, I was smiling? ",1.0,1.0
Iroh,"I'm going to bed now.  Yep, a man needs his rest.  Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed.",1.0,1.0
Zuko,Because their  honor  didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine  does.  This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.,1.0,1.0
Katara,Hey.,1.0,1.0
Aang,Hey. What'cha thinkin' about?,1.0,1.0
Katara,"I guess I was wondering, your being an airbender and all, if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar?",1.0,1.0

Aang," Uh, why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?",1.0,1.0
Kanna,"Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years. We thought they were extinct, until my granddaughter and grandson found you.",1.0,1.0
Aang, Extinct?,1.0,1.0
Katara," Aang, this is my grandmother.",1.0,1.0
Kanna, Call me Gran-Gran.,1.0,1.0
Sokka," What is this, a weapon? You can't  stab  anything with this!",1.0,1.0
Aang, It's not for stabbing! It's for airbending. ,1.0,1.0
Village girl, Magic trick! Do it again!,1.0,1.0
Aang,"Not magic, airbending.  It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.",1.0,1.0

Aang, You're a waterbender?,1.0,1.0
Katara," Well, sort of. Not yet.",1.0,1.0
Kanna,"All right, no more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.",1.0,1.0
Katara," I told you, he's the real thing Gran-Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me!",1.0,1.0
Kanna," Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.",1.0,1.0
Katara,But he's special! I can tell!  I sense he's filled with  much  wisdom.,1.0,1.0
Aang, See? Now my tongue is stuck to my staff!,1.0,1.0
Iroh, Again.,1.0,1.0
Iroh," No!  Power in firebending comes from the breath , not the muscles.  The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire!  Get it right this time.",1.0,1.0
Zuko, Enough! I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set! I'm  more  than ready!,1.0,1.0
Iroh,"No, you are impatient.  You have yet to master your basics.  Drill it again!",1.0,1.0
Zuko, The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.  He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements! I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.  You  will  teach me the advanced set!,1.0,1.0
Iroh," Very well,  but first, I must finish my roast duck. ",1.0,1.0
Sokka," Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.  In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing! For without courage, how can we call ourselves men? ",1.0,1.0
Southern Water Tribe boy, I gotta pee!,1.0,1.0
Sokka," Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on  you  to be the men of this tribe, and that means  no potty breaks  ! ",1.0,1.0
Southern Water Tribe boy,But I really gotta go!,1.0,1.0
Sokka," Okay, who else has to go?",1.0,1.0
Katara, Have you seen Aang? Gran-Gran said he disappeared over  an hour  ago.,1.0,1.0
Aang, Wow!  Everything  freezes in there!,1.0,1.0
Sokka," Uh!  Katara, get him out of here! This lesson is for warriors  only  !",1.0,1.0

Sokka, Stop! Stop it right now!  What's wrong with you?! We don't have time for fun and games with  the War  going on!,1.0,1.0
Aang, What war? What are you talking about?,1.0,1.0
Sokka," You're kidding, right?",1.0,1.0
Aang, Penguin!,1.0,1.0
Sokka,"He's kidding, right?",1.0,1.0
Katara,Aang?,1.0,1.0
Aang," Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding?  Heh heh. I have a way with animals.",1.0,1.0
Katara," Hehehe, Aang, I'll help  you  catch a penguin if you teach  me  waterbending.",1.0,1.0
Aang," You got a deal! Just one little problem ...  I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?",1.0,1.0
Katara, No. You're looking at the  only  waterbender in the whole South Pole.,1.0,1.0
Aang,"This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water.  What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.",1.0,1.0
Katara,"Maybe, but we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly ""turn right at the second glacier"". It's on the other side of  the world  .",1.0,1.0
Aang,"But you forget,  I  have a flying bison.  Appa and I can  personally  fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're going to find you a master!",1.0,1.0
Katara," That's ... I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before.",1.0,1.0
Aang,"Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?",1.0,1.0
Katara," Okay, listen closely my young pupil.  Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art.  Observe!",1.0,1.0
Aang,"Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha!",1.0,1.0
Katara, I haven't done this since I was a kid!,1.0,1.0
Aang,You still  are  a kid!,1.0,1.0
Aang, Whoa! What is  that?,1.0,1.0
Katara," A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people.  Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped!",1.0,1.0
Aang,"If you want to be a bender, you  have  to let go of fear.",1.0,1.0
Katara, This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl.  It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.,1.0,1.0
Aang,"Okay, back up. I have friends  all over  the world, even in the Fire Nation.  I've never seen  any  war.",1.0,1.0
Katara,"Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?",1.0,1.0
Aang," I don't know. A few days, maybe?",1.0,1.0
Katara,I think it was more like a hundred  years!,1.0,1.0
Aang, What?! That's impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you?,1.0,1.0
Katara,"Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there the whole time!  It's the only explanation.",1.0,1.0
Aang,A hundred years!  I can't believe it.,1.0,1.0
Katara," I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this ...",1.0,1.0
Aang, I  did  get to meet you.,1.0,1.0
Katara," Come on, let's get out of here.",1.0,1.0
Katara,"Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy.",1.0,1.0
Aang,Huh?,1.0,1.0
Aang,What's that you said about booby traps?,1.0,1.0
Aang,Uh oh ...  Hold on tight!,1.0,1.0
Katara,Aaah!,1.0,1.0
Zuko,The last airbender!  Quite agile for his old age.  Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar.  As  well  as his hiding place ...,1.0,1.0
Katara,"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.",2.0,1.0
Village kids, Yay! Aang's back!,2.0,1.0
Sokka," I knew it!  You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?",2.0,1.0
Katara, Aang didn't do anything! It was an accident.,2.0,1.0
Aang," Yeah. We were on the ship and there was this booby trap, and, well --  -- we booby-ed right into it.",2.0,1.0
Kanna," Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship! Now we could  all  be in danger!",2.0,1.0
Aang, Don't blame Katara. I brought her there. It's my fault.,2.0,1.0
Sokka," Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy.  The foreigner is banished from our village.",2.0,1.0
Katara," Sokka, you're making a mistake.",2.0,1.0
Sokka," No, I'm keeping my promise to Dad.  I'm protecting you, from threats like him!",2.0,1.0
Katara, Aang is  not  our enemy!  Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time: fun.,2.0,1.0
Sokka, Fun?! We can't fight firebenders with fun!,2.0,1.0
Aang, You should try it sometime.,2.0,1.0
Sokka, Get out of our village!  Now!,2.0,1.0
Katara," Grandmother, please.  Don't  let Sokka do this!",2.0,1.0
Kanna," Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden. Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves.",2.0,1.0
Katara," Fine! Then I'm banished, too!  Come on Aang, let's go.",2.0,1.0
Sokka, Where do you think  you're  going?,2.0,1.0
Katara, To find a waterbender. Aang is taking  me  to the North Pole.,2.0,1.0
Aang, I am?  Great!,2.0,1.0

Katara, Where will you go?,2.0,1.0

Sokka, I'd like that. I'd  reeally  like that.,2.0,1.0
Katara, Then we're in this together!,2.0,1.0
Aang," All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some  serious  business to attend to.  Here, here and here.",2.0,1.0
Katara, What's there? ,2.0,1.0
Aang," Here, we'll ride the hopping llamas.  Then waaay over here, we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish.  Then back over here, we'll ride the hog monkeys.  They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!",2.0,1.0
Aang," Wait 'til you see it, Katara! The Air Temple is one of the most  beautiful  places in the world!",3.0,1.0
Katara," Aang, I know you're excited,  but it's been a hundred years since you've been home.",3.0,1.0
Aang, That's  why  I'm so excited!,3.0,1.0
Katara, It's just that ... a lot can change in all that time.,3.0,1.0
Aang," I know, but I need to see it for myself.",3.0,1.0
Aang," Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple, here we come! ",3.0,1.0
Sokka, Uggh! Sleep now. Temple later.,3.0,1.0
Aang, Sokka! Wake up!  There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!,3.0,1.0
Sokka, Ahh!  Get it off! Get it off!  Ahh!,3.0,1.0
Aang, Great! You're awake! Let's go!,3.0,1.0
Zuko,"Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible. I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail.",3.0,1.0
Iroh, You mean the Avatar?,3.0,1.0
Zuko," Don't mention his name on these docks!  Once word gets out that he's alive, every firebender will be out looking for him, and I don't want anyone getting in the way!",3.0,1.0
Zhao," Getting in the way of what,  Prince Zuko?",3.0,1.0
Zuko, Captain Zhao.,3.0,1.0
Zhao, It's  commander  now. And  General Iroh. Great hero of our nation.,3.0,1.0
Iroh,  Retired  general.,3.0,1.0
Zhao,The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests anytime. What brings you to my harbor?,3.0,1.0
Iroh,Our ship is being repaired.,3.0,1.0
Zhao,That's quite a bit of damage.,3.0,1.0
Zuko,Yes.  You wouldn't believe what happened.  Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened.,3.0,1.0
Iroh, Yes. I will do that.  It was incredible!  What? Did we crash or something?,3.0,1.0
Zuko, Yes! Right into ... an Earth Kingdom ship!,3.0,1.0
Zhao, Really? You must regale me with all of the  thrilling  details.  Join me for a drink?,3.0,1.0
Zuko," Sorry, but we have to go.",3.0,1.0
Iroh,"Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.  We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite.",3.0,1.0
Sokka," Hey, stomach? Be quiet, all right? I'm  trying  to find us some food.",3.0,1.0
Sokka, Hey! Who ate all of my blubbered seal jerky?!,3.0,1.0
Aang, Oh. That was food?  I used it to start the campfire last night.  Sorry.,3.0,1.0
Sokka, You  what  ?!  No wonder the flames smelled so good.,3.0,1.0
Aang, The Patola Mountain range! We're almost there!,3.0,1.0
Katara," Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders.",3.0,1.0
Aang, What about 'em?,3.0,1.0
Katara," Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless.  They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people.",3.0,1.0
Aang," Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. They probably escaped!",3.0,1.0
Katara, I know it's hard to accept.,3.0,1.0
Aang," You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison!  Right, Appa?",3.0,1.0
Aang,Yip yip!,3.0,1.0
Aang, There it is. The Southern Air Temple.,3.0,1.0
Katara,"Aang, it's amazing!",3.0,1.0
Aang," We're home, buddy! We're home. ",3.0,1.0
Zhao,"... And by the year's end, the Earth Kingdom capital will be under our rule.  The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war.",3.0,1.0
Zuko," If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool!",3.0,1.0
Zhao," Two years at sea have done little to temper your tongue. So, how is your search for the Avatar going?",3.0,1.0
Iroh,"Eh.. My fault, entirely.",3.0,1.0
Zuko, We haven't found him yet.,3.0,1.0
Zhao,Did you really expect to? The Avatar  died  a hundred years ago.  Along with the rest of the airbenders.  Unless you have found some evidence that the Avatar is alive?,3.0,1.0
Zuko, No.  Nothing.,3.0,1.0
Zhao," Prince Zuko, the Avatar is the only one who can stop the Fire Nation from winning this war.  If you have an  ounce  of loyalty left, you'll tell me what you found.",3.0,1.0
Zuko,"I haven't found  anything.  It's like you said. The Avatar probably died a long time ago.  Come on, Uncle, we're going.",3.0,1.0
Soldier,"Commander Zhao, we interrogated the crew as you instructed. They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody,  but let him escape.",3.0,1.0
Zhao," Now remind me,  how,  exactly  , was your ship damaged?",3.0,1.0
Sokka,So where do I get something to eat?,3.0,1.0
Katara," You're lucky enough to be one of the  first  outsiders to  ever  visit an airbender temple, and all you can think about is food?",3.0,1.0
Sokka,"I'm just a simple guy, with simple needs.",3.0,1.0
Aang," So that's where my friends and I would play airball,  and over there  is where the bison would sleep, and ... ",3.0,1.0
Katara,What's wrong?,3.0,1.0
Aang, This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison. Now there's just a bunch of weeds.  I can't believe how much things have changed.,3.0,1.0
Sokka," So uh, this airball game. How do you play?",3.0,1.0
Aang," Aang, seven!  Sokka, zero!",3.0,1.0
Sokka," Making him feel better is putting  me  in a world of hurt.  Katara, check this out.",3.0,1.0
Katara,Fire Nation.,3.0,1.0
Sokka,We should tell him.,3.0,1.0
Katara, Aang! There's something you need to see.,3.0,1.0
Aang, Okay!,3.0,1.0
Aang, What is it?,3.0,1.0
Katara, Uh ... Just a new waterbending move I learned.,3.0,1.0
Aang,"Nice one! But enough practicing,  we have a whole temple to see!",3.0,1.0
Sokka," You know, you can't protect him forever.",3.0,1.0
Sokka," Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't.",3.0,1.0
Katara,"I can for Aang's sake. If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated.",3.0,1.0
Aang, Hey guys!  I want you to meet somebody!,3.0,1.0
Sokka,Who's that?,3.0,1.0
Aang, Monk Gyatso! The greatest airbender in the world.  He taught me everything I know.,3.0,1.0
Gyatso,"But the true secret, is in the gooey center.",3.0,1.0
Aang, Hmm ...,3.0,1.0
Gyatso," My ancient cake-making technique isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, Aang?",3.0,1.0
Aang," This whole Avatar thing, m-maybe the monks made a mistake.",3.0,1.0
Gyatso,"The only mistake they made was telling you before you turned sixteen, but we can't concern ourselves with what was. We must act on what is.",3.0,1.0
Aang, But Gyatso? How do I know if I'm ready for this?,3.0,1.0
Gyatso," Your questions will be answered when you're old enough to enter the air temple sanctuary. Inside, you will meet someone who will guide you on your journey.",3.0,1.0
Aang, Who is it?,3.0,1.0
Gyatso," When you are ready, he will reveal himself to you.  Now, are you going to help me with these cakes,  or not?",3.0,1.0
Aang, All right.,3.0,1.0
Gyatso,One.  Two. Three!,3.0,1.0
Gyatso," Your aim has improved greatly,  my young pupil.",3.0,1.0
Katara, You must miss him.,3.0,1.0
Aang, Yeah. ,3.0,1.0
Katara, Where are you going?,3.0,1.0
Aang, The air temple sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet.,3.0,1.0
Katara,"But Aang, no one could have survived in there for a hundred years.",3.0,1.0
Aang, It's not impossible.  I survived in the iceberg for that long.,3.0,1.0
Katara, Good point.,3.0,1.0
Aang," Katara, whoever's in there might help figure out this Avatar thing!",3.0,1.0
Sokka, And whoever's in there might have  a medley of delicious  cured meats!,3.0,1.0
Sokka,I don't suppose you have a key?,3.0,1.0
Aang," The key, Sokka, is airbending.",3.0,1.0
Aang, Hello?  Anyone home?,3.0,1.0
Zhao,So a twelve-year-old boy bested you and your firebenders.  You're more pathetic than I thought.,3.0,1.0
Zuko," I underestimated him  once  , but it will  not  happen again!",3.0,1.0
Zhao," No, it will not. Because you won't have a second chance.",3.0,1.0
Zuko," Commander Zhao,  I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I -",3.0,1.0
Zhao, And you failed!  Capturing the Avatar is too important to leave in a teenager's hands. He's mine now.,3.0,1.0
Zhao,Keep them here.,3.0,1.0
Iroh," More tea, please.",3.0,1.0
Sokka, Statues? That's it? Where's the meat?,3.0,1.0
Katara,Who are all these people?,3.0,1.0
Aang, I'm not sure.  But it feels like I know them somehow. Look!  That one's an airbender.,3.0,1.0
Katara," And this one's a waterbender.  They're lined up in a pattern:  air, water, earth and fire.",3.0,1.0
Aang,That's the Avatar Cycle.,3.0,1.0
Katara," Of course. They're Avatars. All these people are your past lives, Aang.",3.0,1.0
Aang,Wow! There are so many!,3.0,1.0
Sokka," Past lives?  Katara, you really believe in that stuff?",3.0,1.0
Katara,"It's true.  When the Avatar dies, he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.",3.0,1.0
Katara,Aang! Snap out of it!,3.0,1.0
Aang, Huh?,3.0,1.0
Katara, Who is that?,3.0,1.0
Aang,"That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me.",3.0,1.0
Sokka,You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.,3.0,1.0
Katara, There's no writing. How do you know his name?,3.0,1.0
Aang,I'm not sure. I just know it somehow.,3.0,1.0
Sokka, You just couldn't get any weirder.,3.0,1.0
Sokka, Firebender. Nobody make a sound.,3.0,1.0
Katara, You're making a sound!,3.0,1.0
Aang and Sokka, Shhhh!,3.0,1.0
Sokka, That firebender won't know what hit him.,3.0,1.0
Aang, Lemur!,3.0,1.0
Sokka, Dinner!,3.0,1.0
Aang, Don't listen to him. You're going to be my new pet.,3.0,1.0
Sokka, Not if I get him first!,3.0,1.0
Aang,Wait! Come back!,3.0,1.0
Sokka,I want to eat you!,3.0,1.0
Sokka,Hey! No fair!,3.0,1.0
Zhao,"My search party is ready. Once I'm out to sea,  my guards will escort you back to your ship and  you'll be free to go.",3.0,1.0
Zuko, Why? Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?,3.0,1.0
Zhao, You? Stop me? Impossible.,3.0,1.0
Zuko," Don't underestimate me, Zhao! I will capture the Avatar before you!",3.0,1.0
Iroh," Prince Zuko, that's enough.",3.0,1.0
Zhao," You can't compete with me. I have hundreds of war ships under my command and you? You're just a banished prince. No home, no allies. Your own father doesn't even want you.",3.0,1.0
Zuko," You're wrong! Once I deliver the Avatar to my father, he will welcome me home with honor, and restore my rightful place on the throne!",3.0,1.0
Zhao," If your father really wanted you home, he would have let you return by now, Avatar or no Avatar. But in his eyes you are a failure and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.",3.0,1.0
Zuko, That's not true.,3.0,1.0
Zhao,You have the scar to prove it.,3.0,1.0
Zuko, Maybe you'd like one to match!,3.0,1.0
Zhao, Is that a challenge?,3.0,1.0
Zuko,An Agni Kai. At sunset.,3.0,1.0
Zhao,Very well.  It's a shame your father won't be here to watch me humiliate you.  I guess your uncle will do.,3.0,1.0
Iroh," Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?",3.0,1.0
Zuko, I will never forget.,3.0,1.0
Aang," Hey! Come back!  Come on out, little lemur! That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.",3.0,1.0
Aang, Firebenders? They were here?,3.0,1.0
Aang, Gyatso.,3.0,1.0
Sokka," Hey, Aang! You find my dinner yet?  Aang, I wasn't  really  going to eat the lemur, okay?  Oh, man.  Come on, Aang. Everything will be all right. Let's get out of here.",3.0,1.0
Katara, Aang!,3.0,1.0
Fire Sage,Send word to the Fire Lord immediately! The Avatar has returned!,3.0,1.0
Sokka, Aang! Come on! Snap out of it!,3.0,1.0
Sokka,Aaaaahh!,3.0,1.0
Katara, What happened?,3.0,1.0
Sokka, He found out firebenders killed Gyatso!,3.0,1.0
Katara,Oh no! It's his Avatar Spirit!  He must have triggered it! I'm going to try and calm him down! ,3.0,1.0
Sokka," Well, do it! Before he blows us off the mountain!",3.0,1.0
Iroh,"Remember your firebending basics,  Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.",3.0,1.0
Zuko, I refuse to let him win.,3.0,1.0
Zhao, This will be over quickly.,3.0,1.0
Iroh,"Basics, Zuko!  Break his root!",3.0,1.0
Zhao, Do it!,3.0,1.0
Zhao,That's it? Your father raised a coward.,3.0,1.0
Zuko," Next time you get in my way, I promise, I won't hold back.",3.0,1.0
Iroh,"No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory.  So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat?  Disgraceful.  Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you.  Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious.",3.0,1.0
Zuko," Did you really mean that, Uncle?",3.0,1.0
Iroh, Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.,3.0,1.0
Katara," Aang! I know you're upset and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom.  Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone,  but you still have a family. Sokka and I!  We're your family now!",3.0,1.0
Sokka, Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise.,3.0,1.0
Aang, I'm sorry.,3.0,1.0
Katara,It's okay. It wasn't your fault.,3.0,1.0
Aang," But you were right. And if the firebenders found this temple, that means they found the other ones, too.  I really am the last airbender.",3.0,1.0
Katara,Everything's packed. You ready to go?,3.0,1.0
Aang, How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?,3.0,1.0
Katara,Maybe you'll find a way.,3.0,1.0
Aang,Looks like you made a new friend Sokka!,3.0,1.0
Sokka, Can't talk! Must eat! ,3.0,1.0
Aang," Hey, little guy!",3.0,1.0
Aang," You, me and Appa;  we're all that's left of this place.  We have to stick together. Katara, Sokka,  say hello to the newest member of our family.",3.0,1.0
Katara, What are you going to name him?,3.0,1.0
Aang,Momo.,3.0,1.0
Zuko," The only reason you should be interrupting me, is if you have news about the Avatar.",4.0,1.0
Iroh," Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset.",4.0,1.0
Zuko," Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now, whatever you have to say, I'm sure I can take it.",4.0,1.0
Iroh, Okay then.  We have no idea where he is.,4.0,1.0
Zuko, What!?,4.0,1.0
Iroh,You really should open a window in here.,4.0,1.0
Zuko, Give me the map! ,4.0,1.0
Iroh,"Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down.",4.0,1.0
Zuko," How am I going to find him, Uncle?  He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering.",4.0,1.0
Sokka," You have no idea where you're going, do you?",4.0,1.0
Aang,Well ...  I know it's near water.,4.0,1.0
Sokka, I guess we're getting close then.,4.0,1.0
Aang,"Momo, marbles please.  Hey Katara, check out this airbending trick!",4.0,1.0
Katara," That's great, Aang.",4.0,1.0
Aang, You didn't even look.,4.0,1.0
Katara, That's great!,4.0,1.0
Aang, But I'm not doing it now.,4.0,1.0
Sokka," Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.",4.0,1.0
Katara, What does me being a  girl  have to do with sewing?,4.0,1.0
Sokka, Simple. Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that.  It's just the natural order of things.,4.0,1.0
Katara, All done with your pants!  And look what a great job I did!,4.0,1.0
Sokka," Wait! I was just kidding.  I can't wear these! Katara, please!",4.0,1.0
Aang," Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants.",4.0,1.0
Sokka,We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?,4.0,1.0
Katara," He's right. At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring.",4.0,1.0
Aang," But Appa's tired, aren't you boy?",4.0,1.0
Aang," I  said,  aren't you boy?",4.0,1.0
Sokka," Yeah, that was  real  convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten-ton magical monster.",4.0,1.0
Aang, Look!,4.0,1.0
Aang," That's why we're here.  Elephant koi, and I'm gonna ride it. Katara, you've got to watch me!",4.0,1.0
Aang,Cold!,4.0,1.0
Aang," Hahaha, hahaha!",4.0,1.0
Katara, Whooh!,4.0,1.0
Katara, He looks pretty good out there.,4.0,1.0
Sokka, Are you kidding?  The fish is doing all the work.,4.0,1.0
Katara," No, Appa. Don't eat that! ",4.0,1.0
Aang, Oh man ...,4.0,1.0
Sokka, There's something in the water!,4.0,1.0
Katara, What's wrong?,4.0,1.0
Sokka,Aang's in trouble. Aang!,4.0,1.0
Katara,Get out of there!,4.0,1.0
Sokka,"Get back here, Aang!",4.0,1.0
Aang, Whaaaahh! Aaaah!,4.0,1.0
Aang, Whaaaahh!,4.0,1.0
Katara,What was that thing?,4.0,1.0
Aang,I don't know.,4.0,1.0
Sokka," Well, let's not stick around to find out. Time to hit the road.",4.0,1.0
Sokka,"Or, we could stay a while.",4.0,1.0
Oyaji, You three have some explaining to do.,4.0,1.0
Suki," And if you don't answer all our questions, we're throwing you back in the water with the Unagi.",4.0,1.0
Sokka," Show yourselves, cowards!",4.0,1.0
Sokka, Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?,4.0,1.0
Suki," There were no men. We ambushed you. Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?",4.0,1.0
Sokka," Wait a second,  there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.",4.0,1.0
Suki," A bunch of girls, huh? The Unagi's gonna eat well tonight.",4.0,1.0
Katara," No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes. ",4.0,1.0
Aang,It's my fault.  I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.,4.0,1.0
Oyaji, How do we know you're not  Fire Nation spies? Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!,4.0,1.0
Aang, This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!,4.0,1.0
Oyaji, Ha! How could you possibly know her?,4.0,1.0
Oyaji,Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago.  She's been dead for centuries.,4.0,1.0
Aang, I know her because I'm the Avatar.,4.0,1.0
Suki, That's impossible! The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.,4.0,1.0
Aang, That's me!,4.0,1.0
Oyaji, Throw the impostor to the Unagi!,4.0,1.0
Katara, Aang ... do some airbending.,4.0,1.0
Spectators, Wow! Did you see that? Airbender!,4.0,1.0
Oyaji, It's true ... you  are  the Avatar!,4.0,1.0
Aang, Now ...  check this out!,4.0,1.0
Little girl, Did you hear the news?  The Avatar's on Kyoshi!,4.0,1.0
Fisherman, Huh?,4.0,1.0
Zuko," The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?  Uncle, ready the rhinos. He's not getting away from me this time.",4.0,1.0
Iroh, Are you going to finish that?,4.0,1.0
Zuko, I was going to save it for later!,4.0,1.0
Aang, All right! Dessert for breakfast!,4.0,1.0
Aang,These people sure know  how to treat an Avatar!,4.0,1.0
Aang, Mmm ...  Katara you've got to try these!,4.0,1.0
Katara," Well, maybe just a bite.",4.0,1.0
Aang,"Sokka, what's your problem?  Eat!",4.0,1.0
Sokka,Not hungry.,4.0,1.0
Aang, But you're always hungry!,4.0,1.0
Katara, He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.,4.0,1.0
Sokka, They snuck up on me!,4.0,1.0
Katara, Right. And  then  they kicked your butt.,4.0,1.0
Sokka, Sneak attacks don't count!  Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two.  I'm not scared of any girls.  Who do they think they are anyway?  Mmm ... this is tasty.,4.0,1.0
Aang,What's he so angry about?  It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment!,4.0,1.0
Katara,"Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.",4.0,1.0
Aang," I'm sure we'll be fine.  Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town?  They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!",4.0,1.0
Katara,"Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar.  I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.",4.0,1.0
Aang," Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.",4.0,1.0
Painter," Hmmm ... Painting the Avatar ... that's easy enough ...  Oh, there's another one ...  Well, I'll make an adjustment here, and ...  There's more ...  well that ...",4.0,1.0
Sokka, I can't believe I got beat up by a bunch of girls.,4.0,1.0
Sokka," Sorry ladies,  didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.  I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?",4.0,1.0
Suki," Well, you're in the right place.  Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar.",4.0,1.0
Sokka," It's all right.  I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception.",4.0,1.0

Katara,How can you say that? Haru has a gift! Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.,6.0,1.0
Haru's mother, You don't understand.,6.0,1.0
Katara,I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?,6.0,1.0
Haru's mother,They could take Haru away! Like they took his father.,6.0,1.0
Haru,My mom said you can sleep here tonight. But you should leave in the morning.,6.0,1.0
Aang,Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.,6.0,1.0

Haru,"That's okay. It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store? It reminded me of him.",6.0,1.0
Katara, Thanks.,6.0,1.0
Haru,"My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one. But they fought back anyway.",6.0,1.0
Katara,He sounds like a great man.,6.0,1.0
Haru," After the attack, they rounded up my father and every other earthbender, and took them away.  We haven't seen them since.",6.0,1.0
Katara,So that's why you hide your earthbending.,6.0,1.0
Haru,Yeah. Problem is ...  the only way I can feel close to my father now  is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.,6.0,1.0

Aang, And ... why would they do that?,6.0,1.0
Katara, Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending. ,6.0,1.0
Sokka,"I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and  ta-da!  Fake earthbending.",6.0,1.0

Katara, We'll see about that.,6.0,1.0
Katara,"Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.  Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your  courage  . And it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage earthbenders,  let us fight for our freedom!",6.0,1.0

Shyu, This way.,8.0,1.0
Great Fire Sage, Find him.,8.0,1.0
Shyu, Time is running out! Quickly!,8.0,1.0
Zuko," What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?",8.0,1.0
Iroh,Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.,8.0,1.0
Zuko," If Zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.",8.0,1.0
Shyu, Avatar Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma.,8.0,1.0
Aang,Did you know Avatar Roku?,8.0,1.0
Shyu,No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.,8.0,1.0
Aang,Is that how you knew I was coming?,8.0,1.0
Shyu,"A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred. The statue of Avatar Roku; its eyes began to glow!",8.0,1.0
Katara,"That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too!",8.0,1.0
Shyu,"At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.",8.0,1.0
Aang,"If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me?",8.0,1.0
Shyu,"Things have changed. In the past, the sages were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came.",8.0,1.0
Aang, They were waiting for me.,8.0,1.0
Sokka, Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late! ,8.0,1.0
Shyu,"They lost hope the Avatar would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozin began the War, my grandfather and the other sages were forced to follow him.  I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other sages.",8.0,1.0
Aang,Thank you for helping me. ,8.0,1.0
Shyu," We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary.  Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue. Only then will you be able to speak with him.",8.0,1.0
Shyu, No!,8.0,1.0
Aang," Shyu, what's wrong?",8.0,1.0
Shyu,"The sanctuary doors, they're closed!",8.0,1.0
Katara, Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?,8.0,1.0
Shyu,"No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise, the sages must open this door together,  with five simultaneous fire blasts.",8.0,1.0
Sokka," Five fire blasts, huh?  I think I can help you out.",8.0,1.0
Zuko,"Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail, while I use it as a cover.",8.0,1.0
Sokka," This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and,  ta-da! Fake firebending!",8.0,1.0
Katara," You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.",8.0,1.0
Shyu,This might actually work.,8.0,1.0
Shyu," The sages will hear the explosion, so as soon as they go off, you rush in!",8.0,1.0
Katara, It's almost sunset. Are you ready?,8.0,1.0
Aang,Definitely.,8.0,1.0
Aang, They're still locked!,8.0,1.0
Shyu, It didn't work. ,8.0,1.0
Aang," Why, won't, it, open?!",8.0,1.0
Katara, Aang! Stop!  There's nothing else we can do ...,8.0,1.0
Aang, I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing.,8.0,1.0
Sokka, I don't get it. That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.,8.0,1.0
Katara," Sokka, you're a genius!",8.0,1.0
Aang, Wait. How is Sokka a genius? His plan didn't even work.,8.0,1.0
Sokka, Come on Aang. Let her dream.,8.0,1.0
Katara,You're right. Sokka's plan  didn't  work. But it  looks  like it did.,8.0,1.0
Aang, Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years? ,8.0,1.0
Shyu, Come quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary!,8.0,1.0
Great Fire Sage,How did he get in?,8.0,1.0
Shyu,I don't know. But look at the scorch marks! And down there! ,8.0,1.0
Great Fire Sage,"He's inside! Open the doors, immediately! Before he contacts Avatar Roku!",8.0,1.0
Great Fire Sage,It's the Avatar's lemur. He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!,8.0,1.0
Shyu," Now, Aang!",8.0,1.0
Katara, Aang! Now's your chance!,8.0,1.0
Zuko, The Avatar's coming with me!  Close the doors! Quickly!,8.0,1.0
Katara, Go!,8.0,1.0
Katara, He made it!,8.0,1.0
Aang, The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?,8.0,1.0
Zuko, Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!,8.0,1.0
Great Fire Sage,It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.,8.0,1.0
Aang," Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please Avatar Roku, talk to me!",8.0,1.0
Roku,It's good to see you Aang. What took you so long? ,8.0,1.0
Zuko, Why did you help the Avatar?,8.0,1.0
Shyu, Because it was once the sages' duty. It is still our duty.,8.0,1.0
Zhao," What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand, when you explain why you betrayed him.",8.0,1.0
Great Fire Sage, Commander Zhao.,8.0,1.0
Zhao,"And Prince Zuko. It was a noble effort, but your little smokescreen didn't work.  Two traitors in one day, the Fire Lord  will  be pleased.",8.0,1.0
Zuko," You're too late, Zhao! The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.",8.0,1.0
Zhao,"No matter.  Sooner or later, he has to come out. ",8.0,1.0
Roku,"I have something very important to tell you, Aang. That is why, when you were in the Spirit World, I sent my dragon to find you.",8.0,1.0
Aang, Is it about that vision? The one of the comet?,8.0,1.0
Roku,Yes.,8.0,1.0
Aang,What does it mean?,8.0,1.0
Roku,"One hundred years ago,  Fire Lord Sozin used that comet to begin the War. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power, and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.",8.0,1.0
Aang, So the comet made them stronger?,8.0,1.0
Roku, Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.,8.0,1.0
Aang, But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the War  now  ?,8.0,1.0
Roku,"Listen carefully.  Sozin's Comet will return by the end of this summer, and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the War, once and for all.  If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang. You  must  defeat the Fire Lord, before the comet arrives.",8.0,1.0
Aang, But I haven't even started learning waterbending! Not to mention earth and fire!,8.0,1.0
Roku,"Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end. ",8.0,1.0
Zhao,"When those doors open,  unleash all your firepower!",8.0,1.0
Katara, How's Aang gonna make it out of this?,8.0,1.0
Sokka, How are  we  gonna make it out of this?,8.0,1.0
Aang, What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?,8.0,1.0
Roku,"I know you can do it Aang.  For you have done it before.  The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways, for now.",8.0,1.0
Aang,But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?,8.0,1.0
Roku,"I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way.  A great danger awaits you at the temple.  I can help you face the threat. But only if you are ready.",8.0,1.0
Aang, I'm ready.,8.0,1.0
Zhao,Ready ... ,8.0,1.0
Katara, No! Aang!,8.0,1.0
Zhao,Fire! ,8.0,1.0
Shyu, Avatar Roku ...,8.0,1.0
Shyu, Avatar Roku is going to destroy the temple! We  have  to get out of here!,8.0,1.0
Katara,Not  without Aang!,8.0,1.0
Sokka, We got your back.,8.0,1.0
Aang, Thanks. Where's Shyu?,8.0,1.0
Katara, I don't know.,8.0,1.0
Zhao," No  Prince  , no  Avatar  ! Apparently, the only thing I do have is five  traitors!",8.0,1.0
Great Fire Sage, But Commander! Only Shyu helped the Avatar.,8.0,1.0
Zhao," Save your stories for the Fire Lord. As far as I'm concerned, you are all  guilty  !  Take them to the prison hold!",8.0,1.0
Sokka," Would you sit down?  If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off. What's bugging you anyway?",9.0,1.0
Aang, It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.,9.0,1.0
Sokka," Well, let's see. You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.",9.0,1.0
Aang, I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole. What am I gonna do?,9.0,1.0
Katara," Calm down, it's going to be okay.  If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know.",9.0,1.0
Aang, You'd do that?,9.0,1.0
Katara, We'll need to find a good source of water first.,9.0,1.0
Sokka, Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.,9.0,1.0
Sokka, Nice puddle.,9.0,1.0
Aang," Yeah! Don't start without me, boy! ",9.0,1.0
Katara, Remember the reason we're here.,9.0,1.0
Aang, Oh right. Time to practice waterbending. ,9.0,1.0
Sokka, Great. So what am I supposed to do?,9.0,1.0
Aang,You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes. ,9.0,1.0
Sokka," So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's feet?",9.0,1.0
Aang, Mud and bugs!,9.0,1.0
Sokka,Okay. ,9.0,1.0
Zuko, Someone's changing our course.,9.0,1.0
Zuko, What is the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course! ,9.0,1.0
Iroh,"Actually, someone did. I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko. ",9.0,1.0
Zuko, Is it something to do with the Avatar?,9.0,1.0
Iroh,"Even more urgent. It seems, I-  -I have lost my lotus tile. ",9.0,1.0
Zuko, Lotus tile?,9.0,1.0
Iroh,"For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.",9.0,1.0
Zuko, You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?,9.0,1.0
Iroh,"See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call.  Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life.  I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.",9.0,1.0
Sokka,"Yeah, don't get too happy. You've got to do  me  next. ",9.0,1.0
Katara,"This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect. So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away.  Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement right.",9.0,1.0
Aang, Like this? ,9.0,1.0
Katara, That's almost right. If you keep practicing I'm sure eventually—,9.0,1.0
Aang,"Hey, I'm bending it already! ",9.0,1.0
Katara," Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. It took me two months to learn that move.",9.0,1.0
Aang," Well, you had to figure it all on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.",9.0,1.0
Katara, Thanks.,9.0,1.0
Aang,"So, what's next?",9.0,1.0
Katara,"This is a more difficult move. I call it streaming the water.  It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if-  Nice work.  Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.",9.0,1.0
Aang,"Sorry.  Well, don't stop now! Keep 'em coming!",9.0,1.0
Katara," Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave. ",9.0,1.0
Aang,"So, like this? ",9.0,1.0
Sokka, Aang?! ,9.0,1.0
Aang, Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else do you got?,9.0,1.0
Katara, That's enough practicing for today.,9.0,1.0
Sokka," Yeah, I'll say!  You just ""practiced"" our supplies down the river. ",9.0,1.0
Aang," Uh, sorry.  I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.",9.0,1.0
Sokka,My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender. ,9.0,1.0
Sokka, We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely.,9.0,1.0
Aang,"Uh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle! ",9.0,1.0
Sokka, It doesn't even work.  See? Even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.,9.0,1.0
Katara,"No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on. ",9.0,1.0
Oh," Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation! So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here! Don't be shy, come on by!  Oh! You there, I can see from your clothing that you're world-traveling types. Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?",9.0,1.0
Aang, Sure! What are curios?,9.0,1.0
Oh, I'm not entirely sure. But we got 'em! ,9.0,1.0
Aang, Huh?,9.0,1.0
Pirate captain, I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur.  That beast would fetch me a hefty sum if you'd be interested in bartering. ,9.0,1.0
Aang, Momo's not for sale.,9.0,1.0
Katara," Look at this, Aang. It's a waterbending scroll!  Check out these crazy moves.",9.0,1.0
Aang, Where did you get a waterbending scroll?,9.0,1.0
Pirate captain," Let's just say I got it up North, at a most reasonable price, free. ",9.0,1.0
Sokka," Wait a minute ... Sea loving traders, with suspiciously acquired merchandise,  and pet reptile birds?  You guys are pirates!",9.0,1.0
Oh," We prefer to think of ourselves as ""high risk traders.""",9.0,1.0
Katara,"So, how much for the, uh,  traded  scroll?",9.0,1.0
Pirate captain,"I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom.  Unless of course, you kids have two hundred gold pieces on you right now.",9.0,1.0
Aang," I know how to deal with these guys, Katara. Pirates love to haggle.  Watch and learn.  Let's say to the price of, one copper piece! ",9.0,1.0
Pirate captain, The price is two hundred gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare.,9.0,1.0
Aang," Okay, two copper pieces!",9.0,1.0
Pirate captain," It's not as amusing the second time, boy!",9.0,1.0
Katara," Aang, can we get out of here? I feel like we're getting weird looks.",9.0,1.0
Aang,"Aye, we be casting off now! ",9.0,1.0
Aang,"What was that all about, Katara?",9.0,1.0
Sokka,"Yeah, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.",9.0,1.0
Katara, I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.,9.0,1.0
Oh,Hey you! Get back here!,9.0,1.0
Aang," Well, well. Look who's come to their senses. Told you the haggling would pay off.",9.0,1.0

Aang,Nice bending!,11.0,1.0
Canyon guide,"The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information.  Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed.

Canyon guide,"He he he, guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought sacrifices.",11.0,1.0
Canyon guide,"Okay, everyone stand clear of the wall. ",11.0,1.0

Sokka,"We gotta help him!  Okay, now we gotta help  me  ! ",11.0,1.0

Canyon guide,"Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words-",11.0,1.0

Gan Jin leader,It's the Zhangs! They took food down here even after the canyon guide told them not to.,11.0,1.0
Zhang leader,"What? If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day, it's you pampered Gan Jins!",11.0,1.0

Zhang leader,"Sure, unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do!",11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,Gladly.,11.0,1.0
Aang," Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen.  We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines.  Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can find out why they hate each other so much.",11.0,1.0

Zhang leader,"Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket.",11.0,1.0

Katara,You really think it'll rain?,11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,"No, but you can never be too careful, right?",11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,"Would you care for some bread, Katara?",11.0,1.0
Katara,So it was you guys who had food!,11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,"Oh come now, you really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food? Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?",11.0,1.0
Katara," Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.  So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much?",11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,"You seem like a smart girl Katara, I bet you would enjoy hearing some history.  The patriarch of our tribe, Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual. But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the ground, and stole our sacred orb.  Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang.",11.0,1.0
Zhang leader, Care for some meat?,11.0,1.0
Sokka,Would I! ,11.0,1.0
Zhang leader,"I know what you must be thinking, we're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here.",11.0,1.0
Sokka,Hm-hmm.,11.0,1.0
Zhang leader,"The Gan Jin think so badly of us, they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in.",11.0,1.0
Sokka, Hmm.,11.0,1.0
Zhang leader,"Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years.  Our forefather Wei Jin was leaving the western gate of our village, when he saw a figure in the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison.  We Zhangs will never forget that injustice.",11.0,1.0
Sokka,That's just terrible.  You gonna finish that?,11.0,1.0
Aang,"Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts!  Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts.",11.0,1.0
Canyon guide," Lonely isn't it, being impartial?",11.0,1.0
Aang,"I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.",11.0,1.0
Canyon guide,I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated.,11.0,1.0
Canyon guide,"All clear, we're almost to the other side.",11.0,1.0
Aang," Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?",11.0,1.0
Katara,"I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb.",11.0,1.0
Aang,What are you talking about?,11.0,1.0
Sokka,"Yeah Katara, what are you talking about? Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.",11.0,1.0
Katara,Not punished enough if you ask me.,11.0,1.0
Aang," Okay, okay I get it! Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall.  Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.",11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,Maybe the Zhang can climb the wall with their long disgusting fingernails.,11.0,1.0
Zhang leader,"Oh sorry, I forgot that to the Gan Jin unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!",11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,"Why, you dirty thief!",11.0,1.0
Zhang leader,You pompous fool!,11.0,1.0
Aang," Guys, focus! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!",11.0,1.0

Gan Jin leader,Action will!,11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry!,11.0,1.0
Aang,"You know, I take it back. Harsh words aren't so bad!",11.0,1.0
Aang, Is that ... food? Everyone smuggled food down here? Unbelievable! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day? You're all awful!  So hungry. Is that an egg custard in that tart? ,11.0,1.0
Katara,"Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers.",11.0,1.0
Sokka, We barely survived one!,11.0,1.0

Sokka,Me too. I only took their side 'cause they fed me.,11.0,1.0
Aang," Everybody, watch me and do what I do!  Now follow me! We're riding out of this hole!  Everyone, get off!",11.0,1.0
Zhang leader, We made it!,11.0,1.0
Zhang leader,I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that.,11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,And I never knew you Zhangs were so reliable in a pinch.,11.0,1.0
Zhang leader,Perhaps we're not so different after all. ,11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,Too bad we can't rewrite history. You thieves stole our sacred orb from Jin Wei! ,11.0,1.0
Zhang leader, You tyrants unjustly imprisoned Wei Jin for twenty long years!,11.0,1.0
Aang, Wait a second ... Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!,11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader,"Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story.",11.0,1.0
Aang,"No, I mean I really  knew  them. I might not look it, but I'm a hundred and twelve years old. I was there one hundred years ago on the day you're talking about.  There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact, and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for twenty long years but for two short minutes.  There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was just a game.",11.0,1.0
Zhang leader,You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?,11.0,1.0
Aang,"Nope, just a regular ball.",11.0,1.0
Gan Jin man,What about our tribe's redemption ritual?,11.0,1.0
Aang,"That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell ""redemption""!  Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field.",11.0,1.0
Zhang leader, I suppose it's time we forget the past.,11.0,1.0
Gan Jin leader, And look to the future.,11.0,1.0

Katara, I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.,12.0,1.0
Merchant woman," Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?",12.0,1.0
Aang," I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe.",12.0,1.0
Katara, I just realized we're out of money anyway.,12.0,1.0
Shopkeeper, Awww!,12.0,1.0

Aang, Maybe we should find some shelter?,12.0,1.0
Sokka, Are you kidding? Shelter from  what  ?,12.0,1.0
Fisherman's wife,My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.,12.0,1.0
Fisherman,"Well, it's your joints against my brain.",12.0,1.0
Fisherman's wife,"Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, 'cause I ain't comin'.",12.0,1.0
Fisherman,Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him  double  what you get!  How do you like that?,12.0,1.0
Sokka, I'll go.,12.0,1.0
Fisherman,You're hired! ,12.0,1.0
Sokka, What? You said get a job ... and he's  paying double  .,12.0,1.0

Lieutenant Jee,Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all.,12.0,1.0
Iroh, Lucky guess.,12.0,1.0
Zuko, Lieutenant! You'd better learn some respect  – or I will teach it to you. ,12.0,1.0
Jee,"What do  you  know about  respect  ?  The way you talk to everyone around here, from your hard-working crew to your esteemed uncle, shows you know  nothing  about respect!  You don't care about anyone but yourself! Then again, what should I expect from a  spoiled prince  ?",12.0,1.0
Iroh,"Easy now.  Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better.",12.0,1.0
Zuko,I don't need your help keeping order on my ship.,12.0,1.0

Fisherman's wife,The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!,12.0,1.0

Katara,That's right. ,12.0,1.0
Fisherman,"Well, don't be so smiley about it.  The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years! You turned your back on the world!",12.0,1.0
Katara,Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone.,12.0,1.0
Fisherman,"Oh, he wouldn't, huh? Then I guess I must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering. ",12.0,1.0

Katara, What do you mean?,12.0,1.0
Aang, I don't want to talk about it.,12.0,1.0
Katara,"It has to do with your dream, doesn't it?  Talk to me.",12.0,1.0
Aang,"Well, it's kind of a long story.",12.0,1.0
Katara,I'm going to try to get a little fire going.,12.0,1.0
Aang,I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar. I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter.,12.0,1.0
Aang,"First you got to form the ball, then you got to get on quick.",12.0,1.0

Young Zuko,"If I'm going to rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?",12.0,1.0
Iroh,"Very well. But you must promise not to speak.  These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?",12.0,1.0
Young Zuko," Thank you, Uncle.",12.0,1.0
Bujing,The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here.  A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors. So I am recommending the forty-first division.,12.0,1.0
Elder soldier,But the forty-first is entirely new recruits. How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?,12.0,1.0
Bujing,I don't  . They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear. What better to use as bait than fresh meat?,12.0,1.0
Young Zuko, You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?,12.0,1.0
Iroh,"Zuko was right, you see,  but it was not his place to speak out. And there were dire consequences. ",12.0,1.0
Katara,So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?,12.0,1.0
Aang,"Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew was that after I found out, everything began changing.",12.0,1.0
Aang,"Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!",12.0,1.0
Air Nomad boy #2,Not only that! We made up a game you can play with the air scooters!,12.0,1.0

Air Nomad boy #1,"Now that you're the Avatar, it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on.",12.0,1.0
Aang,"But I'm still the same! Nothing's changed! So, what? I can't play?",12.0,1.0
Air Nomad boy #1,That's the only fair way.,12.0,1.0

Aang,Hey!,12.0,1.0
Tashi,You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training!,12.0,1.0
Gyatso,Aang has already trained enough for today.,12.0,1.0
Tashi,Time is short.  Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques.,12.0,1.0

Tashi,Hmph.,12.0,1.0
Iroh,"After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him.  He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this.",12.0,1.0
Jee,Agni Kai. A fire duel.,12.0,1.0
Iroh,"That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood.  When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general.  Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected.  Zuko would have to duel his own father.",12.0,1.0
Aang,"Then, just when I was feeling better, something worse happened.",12.0,1.0
Gyatso,Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.,12.0,1.0
Tashi,You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.,12.0,1.0
Pasang,"Gyatso, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment.",12.0,1.0
Gyatso,All I want is what is best for him.,12.0,1.0
Pasang,But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated! The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.,12.0,1.0
Katara,"That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say.",12.0,1.0
Aang, How could they do that to me? They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved! ,12.0,1.0
Katara,Whoa! Hot cinders!,12.0,1.0
Aang,I'm sorry I got so mad.,12.0,1.0
Katara,You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.,12.0,1.0
Aang,"Well, that's not exactly what happened.  I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do.",12.0,1.0
Gyatso,"Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang? ",12.0,1.0
Aang," I never saw Gyatso again.  Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.",12.0,1.0
Katara,You ran away.,12.0,1.0
Aang,And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.,12.0,1.0
Katara,You don't know what would have-.,12.0,1.0
Aang,The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.,12.0,1.0
Katara,Aang ...,12.0,1.0
Aang,The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world!,12.0,1.0
Katara,"You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.",12.0,1.0
Aang,You don't know that.,12.0,1.0
Katara,I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.,12.0,1.0

Young Zuko,I  won't  fight you.,12.0,1.0
Ozai,"You  will  learn respect,  and  suffering  will be your  teacher.",12.0,1.0
Iroh, I looked away.,12.0,1.0
Jee,I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident.,12.0,1.0
Iroh,"It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.",12.0,1.0
Jee,So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.,12.0,1.0
Iroh,Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.,12.0,1.0
Fisherman's wife,"Help! Oh, please help!",12.0,1.0
Katara, It's okay. You're safe.,12.0,1.0

Man, Really? You think so?  I'm so excited!,14.0,1.0
Wu,And then you will have your third great-grandchild before quietly passing away in your sleep.  Is that enough information for you?,14.0,1.0

Sokka,The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.,14.0,1.0
Aang,You can be too nice?,14.0,1.0
Sokka,"Yep. If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other.",14.0,1.0

Aang,Excuse me.  Where can a guy find one of those things?,14.0,1.0

Aang,"Not just any flower, a panda lily. I've seen it in action and boy, does it work.",14.0,1.0
Sokka,"Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.",14.0,1.0

Village Woman," Yeah, yeah, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, Mr. science and reason lover.",14.0,1.0

Calm man," Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears.",14.0,1.0
Aang," Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here! You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction,  you have to take fate into your own hands!",14.0,1.0

Man with Red Shoes, Can your science explain why it rains?,14.0,1.0
Sokka," Yes! Yes, it can!",14.0,1.0
Katara, They just won't listen to reason. ,14.0,1.0
Aang, But they  will  listen to Aunt Wu!,14.0,1.0
Sokka,I know that's the problem.,14.0,1.0
Aang,"Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.",14.0,1.0
Aang, Shhh! We don't want anyone to hear us.,14.0,1.0
Aang,"Oh, I didn't see you there.",14.0,1.0
Meng," You don't like me, do you? ",14.0,1.0
Aang,Of course I like you.,14.0,1.0
Meng, But not the way I like you.,14.0,1.0
Aang,"Oh, I guess not.",14.0,1.0
Meng,"It's okay. It's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't think of you that way.",14.0,1.0
Aang, I know what you mean.,14.0,1.0
Meng," She's beautiful, by the way.",14.0,1.0
Aang, Huh?,14.0,1.0
Meng," That Water Tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much.  She's sweet, she's a bender  and her hair seems so manageable. ",14.0,1.0

Aang,How did you know?,14.0,1.0
Meng, I've kind of been stalking you.  Heh ...,14.0,1.0

Katara, I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom.,14.0,1.0
Sokka,"Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.",14.0,1.0
Wu, That's very strange. It shouldn't ...  Oh my!,14.0,1.0
Aang,We still can save the village if we act fast.  Sokka has a plan.,14.0,1.0
Sokka, Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.,14.0,1.0
Aang,"If any of you are earthbenders, come with me.",14.0,1.0

Katara, I suppose he is.,14.0,1.0
Aang," By the way, we kind of borrowed your book.",14.0,1.0
Wu,"So you messed with the clouds, did you?",14.0,1.0
Wu, Very clever!,14.0,1.0
Sokka,"No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling.",14.0,1.0
Calm man," But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed and it wasn't. She was right, after all.",14.0,1.0
Sokka, I hate you.,14.0,1.0
Katara," It's okay, Sokka. Everything's going to be all right.",14.0,1.0

Jeong Jeong,"Are you deaf? How can I teach you if you refuse to listen? Before learning firebending you must learn water and earth. Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady and stable, but fire, fire is alive! It breathes, it grows. Without the bender, a rock will not throw itself!

Jeong Jeong,No fire yet.,16.0,1.0
Aang,What?,16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,Power in firebending comes from the breath. That is why you must master proper breath control.,16.0,1.0
Aang,You brought me up here to breathe?,16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,Assume your stance.,16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong, Wider.,16.0,1.0

Aang,I've been breathing for hours!,16.0,1.0

Aang,I want you to stop wasting my time! I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun!  I wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!,16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong," I had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline. He was only concerned with the power of fire - how he could use it to destroy his opponents and wipe out the obstacles in his path, but fire is a horrible burden to bear. Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it. ",16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,"Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love.",16.0,1.0

Aang,What's going on?,16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,Concentrate on your leaf!,16.0,1.0

Katara,I'm sure there's a good reason.,16.0,1.0
Aang,But I'm ready to do so much more.,16.0,1.0
Aang, I did it! I made fire!,16.0,1.0
Katara,"Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.",16.0,1.0
Aang,Now  that's  some firebending!,16.0,1.0

Sokka, I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did!  You burned my sister  !  You burned my sister!  This is all your fault!,16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,I know! Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.,16.0,1.0
Aang,"I'm sorry, I didn't ...  I'm sorry! ",16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,You have healing abilities. The great benders of the Water Tribe sometimes have this ability. I've always wished I were blessed like you - free from this burning curse.,16.0,1.0
Katara,But you're a great master. You have powers that I will never know.,16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,"Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart.",16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,Go get your friends and flee! Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!,16.0,1.0

Katara,"I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang? ",16.0,1.0
Aang,Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.,16.0,1.0

Katara,"I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!",16.0,1.0
Aang, Where?,16.0,1.0
Katara,By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.,16.0,1.0
Aang,I have to help him!,16.0,1.0
Zhao,Look at you. You were once so great. I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage.,16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,"It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao.",16.0,1.0
Zhao,"It's Admiral Zhao, now.",16.0,1.0
Jeong Jeong,That title will not help you against the Avatar. Do not try to fight him! You are no match!,16.0,1.0

Zhao, It's a trick! He's run off into the woods. Find him!  Let's find out what my old master has taught you.,16.0,1.0
Aang, You were Jeong Jeong's student?!,16.0,1.0
Zhao,Until I got bored.,16.0,1.0
Zhao,I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward. But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of! ,16.0,1.0

Sokka,When did you learn that?,16.0,1.0
Katara,I guess I always knew.,16.0,1.0
Sokka, Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble.  Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb!,16.0,1.0

Storyteller," So, travelers. The next time you think you hear a strange, large bird talking, take a closer look. It might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man. A member of a secret group of air walkers, who laugh at gravity, and laugh at those bound to the earth by it!",17.0,1.0
Aang, Aren't airbender stories the greatest? ,17.0,1.0
Katara, Was it realistic? Is that how it was back then?,17.0,1.0

Storyteller," Tell it to the cap,  boy.",17.0,1.0
Storyteller,"Aww, much obliged, little bat-thing. ",17.0,1.0

Aang," Hey, guys, look at this!",17.0,1.0
Katara, They really are airbenders!,17.0,1.0
Aang," No, they're not.",17.0,1.0
Sokka," What do you mean ""they're not""? Those guys are flying!",17.0,1.0
Aang," Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move, they're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.",17.0,1.0
Katara,"I don't know, Aang. That kid seemed pretty spirited. ",17.0,1.0
Sokka,"We better find some solid ground, before it finds us. ",17.0,1.0

Teo,"Yeah, it's great, isn't it?",17.0,1.0
Aang,"No, just unbelievable. ",17.0,1.0
Katara, Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so ... different.,17.0,1.0
Sokka,So better!,17.0,1.0
Aang,This is supposed to be the history of my people.,17.0,1.0
Aang,Ugh!,17.0,1.0
Katara, I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.,17.0,1.0
Aang,It's nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isn't ruined.,17.0,1.0
Man, Look out!,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,What the doodle? Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites? We have to make room for the bathhouse! ,17.0,1.0
Aang, Do you know what you did!? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse!,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,"Well, people around here are starting to stink. ",17.0,1.0

Teo," Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.",17.0,1.0
Aang,What are you doing? Who said you could be here?,17.0,1.0
Mechanist," Hmm, doing here ... A long time ago,  but not a hundred years, my people became refugees  after a terrible flood. My infant son,  Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother.  I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place. Couldn't believe it! Everywhere! Pictures of flying people! But empty,  nobody home. Then,  I came across these fan-like contraptions!",17.0,1.0
Aang,Our gliders.,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,"Yes! Little, light flying machines!  They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air! Then everyone will be on equal ground! So to speak. We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here.  And, after all, isn't that what nature does?",17.0,1.0
Aang,Nature knows where to stop.,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,"I suppose that's true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us. Look at the time!  Come!  The pulley system must be oiled before dark.",17.0,1.0
Sokka,"Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same.",17.0,1.0
Mechanist,The candle will tell us. Watch. ,17.0,1.0
Sokka,You put spark powder in the candle!,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,"Four flashes. So it's exactly four hours past mid-day. Or, as I call it: four o'candle.  If you like that, wait till you see my finger-safe knife sharpener.  Only took me three tries to get it right. ",17.0,1.0
Sokka, Aaah!,17.0,1.0
Mechanist, Follow me! ,17.0,1.0
Teo,"Hey, Aang. I want to show you something.",17.0,1.0
Aang,I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.,17.0,1.0
Teo,I don't know about that. The temple might be different  but the creatures that live here  are probably direct descendants of the ones who lived here a long time ago.,17.0,1.0
Katara, You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temple's origins. ,17.0,1.0
Teo,"Besides, there's one part of the temple that hasn't changed at all.",17.0,1.0
Katara,"Hey, it's just like the one in the other temple!",17.0,1.0
Teo," Only an airbender can open it, so inside it's completely untouched. Just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it's like in there ...",17.0,1.0
Katara, Aang?,17.0,1.0
Aang, I'm sorry. This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was. I want it to stay that way.,17.0,1.0
Teo, I completely understand. I just wanted you to know that it's here.,17.0,1.0
Aang,Thanks. ,17.0,1.0
Sokka,These lanterns are terrible. I can't see!  Why would you want to use fireflies for light? ,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose!  Fireflies are a non-flammable light source. ,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,Cover your nose  and hold your breath. ,17.0,1.0
Sokka, Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.,17.0,1.0
Mechanist," Wrong. It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly blew my self and the whole place even more sky high! Thought my eyebrows would never grow back.  Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time, we have gas leaks. And they're nearly impossible to find.",17.0,1.0
Sokka,"So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen.",17.0,1.0
Mechanist,"Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell, or touch.",17.0,1.0
Teo,The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you. Something even lighter than air.  And that something takes over when you fly. ,17.0,1.0
Katara, I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something.,17.0,1.0
Teo, Impossible! Everybody has it!,17.0,1.0
Aang,Spirit.,17.0,1.0
Teo,What?,17.0,1.0
Aang,Spirit. That's the something you're talking about.,17.0,1.0
Teo," Yeah, I suppose it is.",17.0,1.0
Teo,Are you ready?,17.0,1.0
Katara,No!  Aaaaah!  I can't believe I'm flying!,17.0,1.0
Aang,Just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug! ,17.0,1.0
Katara,"Teo was right about the air. All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me.",17.0,1.0
Aang,"Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one!  I've been thinking. If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.",17.0,1.0
Teo,Great!,17.0,1.0
Katara,"Wait!  How do I land this thing? What if I land over  a-ack-ack-bleck! Bug! Bug! Ack, that was a bug!",17.0,1.0
Mechanist,"I said don't touch anything!  Oh, don't worry. That experiment's old,  and that egg was just part of last week's lunch.",17.0,1.0
Sokka, Ugh! Week old egg smell!,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,"Quick, find that egg! ",17.0,1.0
Teo,I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside!,17.0,1.0
Sokka,How can something so small that you can't even see it make such a big stink!?,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,That's the solution to our problem!,17.0,1.0
Sokka,Yeah ...  if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up ...,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,... The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs!,17.0,1.0
Sokka,"Then, if there's a leak ...",17.0,1.0
Mechanist,"... You smell rotten eggs! Then, you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from ...",17.0,1.0
Sokka,And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!,17.0,1.0
Both,You're a genius! ,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,Something's wrong.  I've go to go! ,17.0,1.0
Aang,This is a nightmare.,17.0,1.0
Mechanist, You don't understand!,17.0,1.0
Aang, You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!,17.0,1.0
Sokka, You make weapons for the Fire Nation?!,17.0,1.0
Teo,Explain all this! Now!,17.0,1.0
Mechanist," It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement. You were too young to remember this, Teo. They were going to destroy everything! Burn it to the ground! I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us! They asked what I had to offer. I offered ... my services. You must understand. I did this for you!",17.0,1.0
Aang,When are they coming?,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,Soon.  Very soon.,17.0,1.0
Aang,You can't give them more weapons.,17.0,1.0

Mechanist,I need some time to think.  You need to leave! Go!,17.0,1.0
Teo,We're not leaving!,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,Then hide! Quickly! ,17.0,1.0
Qin,You know better than to keep me waiting. Give me what you owe us so we can be on our way.  Well? Is there a problem?,17.0,1.0

Qin,Then the destruction of this temple  will be on your head! ,17.0,1.0
Teo,This is bad.,17.0,1.0
Sokka,Very bad!,17.0,1.0
Katara,"Aang, what are we going to do? How can we possibly keep them all away?",17.0,1.0
Aang,I'll tell you how. We have something they don't.  Air power. We control the sky. That's something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!,17.0,1.0
Mechanist,I want to help. ,17.0,1.0
Aang,Good. We'll need it.,17.0,1.0

Mechanist,Thank you! ,17.0,1.0
Sokka,"See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne,  but once it did, it just kept going.  You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?",17.0,1.0
Katara,"Ugh, if only we knew. ",17.0,1.0
Sokka,"A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.",17.0,1.0

Sokka," So ... uhhh ... you're a princess, huh?  You know, back in my tribe, I'm kind of like a prince, myself. ",18.0,1.0
Katara," Ha, prince of what?",18.0,1.0
Sokka,A lot of things! Do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here.,18.0,1.0
Katara," My apologies,  Prince  Sokka.",18.0,1.0
Sokka,"So, it looks like I'm going to be in town for a while. I'm thinking ... maybe we could ... do an activity, together?",18.0,1.0
Yue, Do an activity?,18.0,1.0
Katara,Very smooth ...,18.0,1.0
Arnook,"Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar. ",18.0,1.0
Pakku,"Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment.",18.0,1.0
Aang,My friend and I can't wait to start training with you! After we relax for a couple of days.,18.0,1.0

Zhao,I'm taking your crew.,18.0,1.0
Zuko, What?! ,18.0,1.0
Zhao,I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.,18.0,1.0
Zuko,"Uncle, is that true?",18.0,1.0
Iroh,I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone ...  even the cook.,18.0,1.0
Zhao,Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar. But I can't have you getting in my way again.,18.0,1.0
Iroh, No!,18.0,1.0
Zhao,"I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.",18.0,1.0
Zuko,I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.,18.0,1.0
Zhao,"Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?",18.0,1.0
Iroh,Just rumors. I don't think he is real.,18.0,1.0
Zhao,"He's real, all right.  He's a criminal, and an enemy of the Fire Nation. But I have a feeling justice will catch up with him soon.  General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands ... if you change your mind.",18.0,1.0
Katara, I've waited for this day my whole life. I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!,18.0,1.0

Pakku," No, please, march right in. I'm not concentrating or anything.",18.0,1.0
Aang,"Uhhh ... This is my friend, Katara. The one I told you about?",18.0,1.0
Pakku,"I'm sorry, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You didn't tell me your friend was a girl. In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.",18.0,1.0
Katara, What do you mean you won't teach me? I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me no!,18.0,1.0
Pakku,No.,18.0,1.0
Katara,But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!,18.0,1.0
Pakku,"Here, the women learn from Yagoda to use their waterbending to heal. I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student, despite your bad attitude.",18.0,1.0
Katara,"I don't want to heal, I want to fight!",18.0,1.0
Pakku,"I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.",18.0,1.0
Katara," Well, your rules stink!",18.0,1.0
Aang," Yeah, they're not fair! If you won't teach Katara, then ...",18.0,1.0
Pakku,Then what?,18.0,1.0
Aang,Then I won't learn from you!,18.0,1.0
Pakku,"Well, have fun teaching yourself! I'm sure you'll do a great job.",18.0,1.0
Katara,"Wait! Aang didn't mean that!  You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku, even if he is a big jerk.",18.0,1.0
Pakku,"Why don't we get started, then? ",18.0,1.0
Sokka,"Princess Yue, good morning! How about that picnic last night? Boy, your dad sure does know how to throw a party.",18.0,1.0
Yue,I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.,18.0,1.0

Yue,"Do an activity, you mean?",18.0,1.0
Sokka,Yes ... at a place ... for some time.,18.0,1.0

Pirate captain,What do you need us to do?,18.0,1.0
Zhao,I believe you're acquainted with Prince Zuko.,18.0,1.0

Yagoda,Are you here for the healing lesson?,18.0,1.0
Katara, I guess I am.,18.0,1.0

Pakku,"You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull.",18.0,1.0
Aang,I'm trying ...,18.0,1.0
Pakku, Maybe that move is too advanced for you. Why don't you try an easier one?,18.0,1.0
Katara,Thanks for the lesson.,18.0,1.0
Yagoda,"So, who's the lucky boy?",18.0,1.0
Katara,Huh?,18.0,1.0
Yagoda,"Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right?",18.0,1.0
Katara, Ah ... No. I don't think I'm ready for that yet. My grandmother gave my mother this necklace and my mother passed it down to me.,18.0,1.0
Yagoda,I recognize this carving! I don't know why I didn't realize sooner; you're the spitting image of Kanna!,18.0,1.0
Katara," Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name?",18.0,1.0
Yagoda,"When I was about your age, I was friends with Kanna. She was born here in the Northern Tribe.",18.0,1.0
Katara,She never told me.,18.0,1.0
Yagoda,Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender. He carved that necklace for her.,18.0,1.0
Katara,"If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?",18.0,1.0
Yagoda,I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.,18.0,1.0
Crew member,Good luck!,18.0,1.0
Iroh, The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.,18.0,1.0
Zuko, Good riddance to those traitors.,18.0,1.0
Iroh,It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head.  Or just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.,18.0,1.0
Oh,Careful with the blasting jelly!,18.0,1.0
Zuko," Uncle? Uncle, is that you? ",18.0,1.0
Iroh,Zuko!  Zuko ...,18.0,1.0
Sokka,"Hi, Princess Yue. I made you something. I carved it myself.",18.0,1.0
Yue,It's a bear.,18.0,1.0
Sokka,"Actually, it's supposed to be a fish.  See, it has a fin.",18.0,1.0
Yue,"Oh. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have asked you to come here. ",18.0,1.0
Katara,How's warrior training going? ,18.0,1.0
Aang,That bad?,18.0,1.0
Sokka,"No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it, one minute she wants to go out with me, and the next, she's telling me to get lost.  So, how's waterbending training?",18.0,1.0
Aang,Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.,18.0,1.0
Sokka,"Why don't you just teach her, Aang?",18.0,1.0
Katara," Why didn't I think of that? At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learn from Master Pakku! That way, you have someone to practice with, and I get to learn waterbending! Everyone's happy!",18.0,1.0
Sokka,I'm not happy.,18.0,1.0
Katara,"But you're never happy. Come on, Aang.",18.0,1.0
Aang, Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating. ,18.0,1.0
Katara, I got it!,18.0,1.0
Aang,That was amazing!,18.0,1.0
Katara,That wasn't me.,18.0,1.0
Aang,I was just showing Katara a few moves.,18.0,1.0
Pakku,"You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture.",18.0,1.0
Aang,"I'm sorry, I ...",18.0,1.0
Pakku,You are no longer welcome as my student.,18.0,1.0
Arnook,What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student?,18.0,1.0
Katara,Yes ... please!,18.0,1.0
Arnook,"I suspect he might change his mind, if you swallow your pride and apologize to him.",18.0,1.0
Katara,Fine.,18.0,1.0
Pakku,"I'm waiting, little girl.",18.0,1.0
Katara,No.  No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you! ,18.0,1.0
Aang,Uhhh ... Katara?,18.0,1.0
Katara,I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me.,18.0,1.0
Aang,I'm sure she didn't mean that.,18.0,1.0
Sokka,"Yeah, I think she did.",18.0,1.0
Zhao,I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko. Just ... devastated.,18.0,1.0
Iroh,The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.,18.0,1.0
Zhao,You know who was behind the attack?,18.0,1.0
Iroh,Yes ... pirates. We had a run-in with them a while back. They wanted revenge.,18.0,1.0
Zhao," So, have you reconsidered my offer?",18.0,1.0
Iroh,"Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation!",18.0,1.0
Zhao,To victory!,18.0,1.0
Sokka,"Are you crazy, Katara? You're not going to win this fight!",18.0,1.0
Katara, I know! I don't care!,18.0,1.0
Aang,You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.,18.0,1.0
Katara,"I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!  So, you decided to show up?  Aren't you going to fight?",18.0,1.0
Pakku,"Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong.  Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad? Study closely!  Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you!",18.0,1.0
Katara, You can't knock me down!,18.0,1.0
Aang,"Go, Katara!",18.0,1.0
Pakku,"Well, I'm impressed. You  are  an excellent waterbender.",18.0,1.0
Katara,"But you still won't teach me, will you?",18.0,1.0
Pakku,No.,18.0,1.0
Pakku,This fight is over.,18.0,1.0
Katara,Come back here. I'm not finished yet!,18.0,1.0
Pakku,"Yes, you are.  This is my necklace ...",18.0,1.0
Katara,"No, it's not. It's mine! Give it back!",18.0,1.0
Pakku,I made this sixty years ago for the love of my life ... for Kanna.,18.0,1.0
Katara, My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you?,18.0,1.0
Iroh,Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.,18.0,1.0
Zuko,You didn't have to do this.,18.0,1.0
Iroh,No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup.,18.0,1.0
Zuko,"Thank you, Uncle.",18.0,1.0
Iroh,Someone's coming. Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours. Good luck. ,18.0,1.0
Pakku,"I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged. I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her.",18.0,1.0
Katara,"But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage. Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage.",18.0,1.0
Aang, Go get her.,18.0,1.0
Yue,What do you want from me?,18.0,1.0
Sokka,"Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.",18.0,1.0
Yue,You don't understand.,18.0,1.0
Sokka,"No, no. See, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a Princess, and I'm ... I'm just a Southern peasant.",18.0,1.0
Yue,"No, Sokka ...",18.0,1.0
Sokka,"It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see you around, okay?  Okay, now I'm really confused.  Happy  , but confused.",18.0,1.0
Yue,"I do like you, a lot. But we can't be together, and not for the reason you think. It's because ... I'm engaged.  I'm sorry. ",18.0,1.0
Pakku,"Not bad, not bad.  Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age.",18.0,1.0
Aang,"Hey, Katara!",18.0,1.0
Pakku,What do you think you're doing?  It's past sunrise. You're late.,18.0,1.0
Aang,Good to see you here.,18.0,1.0
Katara,"You, too.",18.0,1.0
Zhao,My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.,18.0,1.0
Pakku," Nice try, Pupil Sangok.  A couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge.  Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara?  Katara, you've advanced more quickly than any student I've ever trained.  You have proven that with fierce determination, passion and hard work, you can accomplish anything.  Raw talent alone is not enough.  Pupil Aang!",19.0,1.0
Aang," Yes, Master Pakku?",19.0,1.0
Pakku," Care to step into the sparring circle? I figure since you've found time to play with house pets, you must have already mastered waterbending.",19.0,1.0
Aang," I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out.",19.0,1.0
Yue,So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe?,19.0,1.0
Sokka, Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.,19.0,1.0
Yue," Sokka, this is wrong.",19.0,1.0
Sokka, What's wrong? We're taking a walk!,19.0,1.0
Yue, I'm engaged. It just feels ...,19.0,1.0
Sokka," I know what you need.  You need to meet my good friend, Appa.",19.0,1.0
Yue, Who?,19.0,1.0
Sokka," Appa and I go way back, don't we, boy?  Ah, ah, easy! Down boy! Agh! No, up!",19.0,1.0
Yue,Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention!,19.0,1.0
Yue," So, how does this work?",19.0,1.0
Sokka,You holding on tight?  Yip ...  yip.,19.0,1.0
Yue," Oh ... my ... goodness!  Wow, I can't believe you do this every day.",19.0,1.0
Sokka," Yeah, we pretty much live up here.",19.0,1.0
Yue,Is it always this cold in the sky? ,19.0,1.0
Sokka, Not when you're with someone.,19.0,1.0

Sokka, Oh no ...,19.0,1.0
Sokka, Soot.,19.0,1.0
Yue,What?,19.0,1.0
Sokka,"I've seen this before, right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow. ",19.0,1.0
Yue,"But, why?",19.0,1.0
Sokka," It's the Fire Nation.  They've closed in on the North Pole and from the looks of this stuff,  I'd say there's a lot of them.",19.0,1.0
Zhao," This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh.  Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao, who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You're lucky you're here to see it.",19.0,1.0
Iroh," Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.",19.0,1.0
Zhao,"I suppose you speak from experience, but rest assured. This will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se. ",19.0,1.0
Iroh," I hope not, for your sake.",19.0,1.0
Zhao,Tell the captains to prepare for first strike.,19.0,1.0
Iroh, We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?,19.0,1.0
Zuko," I'm working on it, Uncle. ",19.0,1.0
Sokka, What's wrong?  We have to go!,19.0,1.0
Yue," No, Sokka, wait, I can't see you anymore. Not at all.",19.0,1.0
Sokka, What? We're just friends.,19.0,1.0
Yue,"I wish we could just be friends, but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you. I'm marrying someone else! ",19.0,1.0
Sokka,"You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.",19.0,1.0
Yue,But I do love my people.,19.0,1.0

Arnook,"The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire Nation is on our doorstep. It is with great sadness I call my family here before me, knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from our tribe,  but they will never vanish from our hearts.

Hahn, What's your problem?,19.0,1.0
Sokka,Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.,19.0,1.0
Hahn, Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers.,19.0,1.0
Sokka," When, like, a hundred years ago?",19.0,1.0
Arnook,Eighty-five.,19.0,1.0
Sokka, The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined.,19.0,1.0
Hahn,How do we know we can trust this guy?  Such bold talk for a new recruit.,19.0,1.0

Iroh, Zuko! Let's go!,1.0,2.0
Azula,"You know, Father blames Uncle for the loss of the North Pole. And he considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar!  Why would he want  you  back home, except to lock you up  where you can no longer embarrass him?",1.0,2.0
Fong, Avatar Aang! Can you hear me? Your friend is safe!  It was just a trick to trigger the Avatar State ...  and it worked!,1.0,2.0

Aang," I'm sorry, Katara. I hope you never have to see me like that again.",1.0,2.0
Fong, Ha! Are you joking? That was almost perfect!  We just have to find out a way to control you when you're like that.,1.0,2.0
Aang, You're out of your mind.,1.0,2.0
Fong,I guess we'll figure it out on the way to the Fire Nation.,1.0,2.0
Sokka,Anybody got a problem with that?,1.0,2.0

Aang,They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler!,2.0,2.0

Chong,There's an old story about a secret pass right through the mountains.,2.0,2.0
Katara,Is this real or a legend?,2.0,2.0
Chong,"Oh, it's a real legend. And it's as old as earthbending itself.  Two lovers, forbidden from one another, the war divides their people and the mountain divides them apart! Built a path to be together!  Yeah, I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes ...  Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountains, secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!",2.0,2.0
Sokka, I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine.,2.0,2.0

Iroh,I did ...  and it wasn't. ,2.0,2.0
Zuko, Ahh!,2.0,2.0
Iroh," When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing.  But look what I found.  These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade.  That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness.",2.0,2.0
Zuko, We're not taking any more chances with these plants! We need to get help.,2.0,2.0

Zuko, Earth Kingdom it is.,2.0,2.0
Sokka,How far are we from the tunnel?,2.0,2.0
Chong,"Actually, it's not just one tunnel. The lovers didn't want anyone to find out about their love, so they built a whole labyrinth!",2.0,2.0
Sokka, Labyrinth?,2.0,2.0
Chong," Oh, I'm sure we'll figure it out.",2.0,2.0
Lily,All you need to do is trust in love ... according to the curse.,2.0,2.0
Sokka, Curse!,2.0,2.0
Chong,Hey-hey! We're here!,2.0,2.0
Sokka, What exactly is this curse?,2.0,2.0
Chong,"The curse says that only those who trust in love can make it through the caves. Otherwise, you'll be trapped in them forever.",2.0,2.0
Lily,And die.,2.0,2.0

Moku," Hey, someone's making a big campfire!",2.0,2.0
Katara," That's no campfire, Moku.",2.0,2.0
Sokka, It's Fire Nation. They're tracking us.,2.0,2.0
Aang, So all you need to do is trust in love to get through these caves?,2.0,2.0
Chong,"That is correct, Master Arrowhead.",2.0,2.0
Aang, We can make it.,2.0,2.0
Sokka, Everyone into the hole!,2.0,2.0
Commander,Hold on! It's too dangerous. Haven't you heard the song? Just close them in. The mountain will take care of the rest.,2.0,2.0
Katara,"It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. I hope.",2.0,2.0
Sokka,"We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last?",2.0,2.0
Chong," Uh, about two hours each.",2.0,2.0
Lily," And we have five torches, so that's ten hours!",2.0,2.0
Sokka, It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!,2.0,2.0
Lily,"Oh, right.",2.0,2.0
Sokka,I'm going to make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through.,2.0,2.0
Song," You two must not be from around here. We know better than to touch the White Jade, much less make it into tea and drink it. ",2.0,2.0
Iroh, Whoops!,2.0,2.0
Song,So where are you traveling from?,2.0,2.0
Zuko," Yes, we're travelers.",2.0,2.0
Song,Do you have names?,2.0,2.0
Zuko,"Names? Of course we have names.  I'm, uh ... Lee and this is my Uncle, uh ... Mushi?",2.0,2.0
Iroh," Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior. ",2.0,2.0
Song,"Mushi and Junior, huh. My name is Song. You two look like you could use a good meal.  Why don't you stay for dinner?",2.0,2.0
Zuko," Sorry, but we need to be moving on.",2.0,2.0
Song, That's too bad.  My mom always makes too much roast duck.,2.0,2.0
Iroh, Where do you live exactly?,2.0,2.0
Katara,"Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.",2.0,2.0
Sokka,This doesn't make sense. We already came through this way.,2.0,2.0
Chong,We don't need a map.  We just need love. The little guy knows it.,2.0,2.0
Aang,"Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map also.",2.0,2.0
Sokka, There's something strange here. There's only one explanation.  The tunnels are changing.,2.0,2.0
Song's mother, My daughter tells me you're refugees. We were once refugees ourselves.,2.0,2.0
Song," When I was a little girl, the Fire Nation raided our farming village. All the men were taken away. That was the last time I saw my father.",2.0,2.0
Zuko, I haven't seen my father in many years.,2.0,2.0
Song," Oh, is he fighting in the War?",2.0,2.0
Zuko, Yeah. ,2.0,2.0
Chong," The tunnels, they're a-changin'. It must be the curse! I knew we shouldn't have come down here!",2.0,2.0
Sokka," Right, if only we listened to you.",2.0,2.0
Katara, Everyone be quiet. Listen.,2.0,2.0
Chong,It's a giant flying thing with teeth!,2.0,2.0
Moku, No! It's a wolfbat!,2.0,2.0
Chong,"Yeah, it's no use. We're separated. But at least you have us!",2.0,2.0
Sokka, Nooooo!,2.0,2.0
Song,Can I join you? I know what you've been through. We've all been through it.  The Fire Nation has hurt you.,2.0,2.0
Song," It's okay. They've hurt me, too. ",2.0,2.0
Chong," Oh, don't let the cave-in get you down!  Don't let the falling rocks turn your smile into a frown!  When the tunnels are darkest, that's when you need a clown, hey!  Don't let the cave-in get you down, Sokka!",2.0,2.0
Katara," Aang, look!",2.0,2.0
Aang, We found the exit!,2.0,2.0
Katara,This isn't the exit.,2.0,2.0
Aang, No. It's a tomb.,2.0,2.0
Aang,It must be the two lovers from the legend; that's who's buried here.,2.0,2.0
Katara,These pictures tell their story.,2.0,2.0
Katara, They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages ...,2.0,2.0
Katara," The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ...  but their love was strong and they found a way.",2.0,2.0
Katara, The two lovers learned earthbending from the badgermoles; they became the first earthbenders.,2.0,2.0
Katara," They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly.  Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth.  But, one day, the man didn't come  - he'd died in the war between the two villages.  Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ...  but, instead, she declared the war over.  Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace.  The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu.  The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.",2.0,2.0
Katara, Love is brightest  in the dark.,2.0,2.0
Moku,"Oh, great! Your plans have led us to  another  dead end!",2.0,2.0
Sokka," At least I'm  thinking  of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku.",2.0,2.0
Chong,"Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We're thinking of  ideas‌  ? Because I've had an idea for, like, an hour now.",2.0,2.0
Sokka, Yes! We're all thinking of ideas!,2.0,2.0
Chong,"Well, then listen to this: If love is the key out of here, then all we need to do is play a love song! ",2.0,2.0
Aang,How are we going to find our way out of these tunnels?,2.0,2.0
Katara,I have a crazy idea.,2.0,2.0
Aang, What?,2.0,2.0
Katara, Never mind. It's too crazy.,2.0,2.0
Aang,"Katara, what is it?",2.0,2.0
Katara,I was thinking ... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love ...,2.0,2.0
Aang,Right ...,2.0,2.0
Katara," And here, it says, ""Love is brightest in the dark,"" and has a picture of them kissing.",2.0,2.0
Aang, Where are you going with this?,2.0,2.0
Katara," Well, what if we ... kissed?",2.0,2.0
Aang, Us ...  kissing‌  ?,2.0,2.0
Katara,See? It was a crazy idea.,2.0,2.0
Aang, Us ...  kissing  ...,2.0,2.0
Katara, Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine  that‌  ?,2.0,2.0
Aang, Yeah.  I definitely wouldn't want to kiss  you  ! ,2.0,2.0
Katara," Oh, well! I didn't realize it was  such  a  horrible  option.  Sorry I suggested it!",2.0,2.0
Aang," No, no, I mean ... if there was a choice between kissing you and  dying  ...",2.0,2.0
Katara, Ugh!,2.0,2.0
Aang, What? I'm saying is I would rather kiss you than die - that's a compliment.,2.0,2.0
Katara," Well, I'm not sure  which  I'd rather do! ",2.0,2.0
Aang, What is  wrong  with me ...,2.0,2.0
Chong," Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart ...",2.0,2.0
Iroh,Thank you for the duck. It was excellent.,2.0,2.0
Song's mother,You're welcome. It brings me pleasure to see someone eat my cooking with such ... gusto.,2.0,2.0
Iroh, Much practice.,2.0,2.0
Iroh,"Junior, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people.",2.0,2.0
Zuko, Thank you.,2.0,2.0
Song,"I know you don't think there's any hope left in the world, but there is hope. The Avatar has returned.",2.0,2.0
Zuko, I know.,2.0,2.0
Iroh,What are you doing? These people just showed you great kindness.,2.0,2.0
Zuko,They're about to show us a little more kindness. Well?,2.0,2.0
Aang,"We're going to run out of light any second now, aren't we?",2.0,2.0
Katara,I think so ...,2.0,2.0
Aang,"Then, what are we going to do?",2.0,2.0
Katara,What  can  we do?,2.0,2.0
Chong,"Hey! You saved us, Sokka!",2.0,2.0
Sokka,"No, they were trying to get away from something!",2.0,2.0
Chong,From what?,2.0,2.0
Chong,"Hey, those things are music lovers!",2.0,2.0
Sokka," Badgermoles coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out!",2.0,2.0
Chong," The big, bad badgermoles who earthbend the tunnels, hate the wolfbats, but love the sounds!",2.0,2.0
Aang,They're made of some kind of crystal. They must only light up in the dark.,2.0,2.0
Katara,That's how the two lovers found each other.  They just put out their lights and followed the crystals.  That must be the way out! ,2.0,2.0
Aang,"So, uh ...",2.0,2.0
Katara,Let's go!,2.0,2.0
Aang,What about Sokka?,2.0,2.0
Katara,Sokka!,2.0,2.0
Sokka,How did you guys get out?,2.0,2.0
Aang,"Just like the legend said, we let love lead the way. ",2.0,2.0
Sokka,"Really? We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way.",2.0,2.0
Katara,Why is your forehead all red?,2.0,2.0
Chong, Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you: I think that kid might be the Avatar!,2.0,2.0
Aang,So are you guys going to come to Omashu with us?,2.0,2.0
Moku,Nope.,2.0,2.0
Aang,"Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku.",2.0,2.0
Chong,"Sokka, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the way of the journey. ",2.0,2.0
Sokka, Just play your songs.,2.0,2.0
Chong,"Hey! Good plan!  Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart. Da, da, da ...",2.0,2.0
Sokka," The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about: the destination.  I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O-  Oh no ...",2.0,2.0
Aang," I can't believe it. I know the War has spread far,  but Omashu always seemed ... untouchable.",3.0,2.0
Sokka,Up until now it was.  Now Ba Sing Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.,3.0,2.0
Katara," This is horrible,  but we have to move on.",3.0,2.0
Aang,"No, I'm going in to find Bumi.",3.0,2.0
Sokka,"Aang, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still ...",3.0,2.0
Aang, What? If he's still what?,3.0,2.0
Sokka, A-around.,3.0,2.0
Katara,"I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people who can teach you earthbending.",3.0,2.0
Aang,This isn't about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend.,3.0,2.0
Sokka,A secret passage? Why didn't we just use this last time?,3.0,2.0
Sokka,Ugh!,3.0,2.0
Aang,That answer your question?,3.0,2.0
Sokka,Eww!,3.0,2.0
Katara,That wasn't as bad as I thought.,3.0,2.0
Sokka, Ahh! They won't let go! Help!,3.0,2.0
Aang, Shh! Stop making so much noise. It's just a purple pentapus.,3.0,2.0
Guard one,Hey! What are you kids doing out past curfew?,3.0,2.0
Katara,Sorry. We were just on our way home.,3.0,2.0
Guard one," Wait, what's the matter with him?",3.0,2.0
Katara,"Uh, he has pentapox, sir.  Umm, it's highly contagious.",3.0,2.0
Sokka," Oh, it's so awful. I'm dying.",3.0,2.0
Katara,And deadly.,3.0,2.0
Guard two,"Hey, I think I heard of pentapox! Didn't your cousin Chang die of it?",3.0,2.0
Guard one,"We'd better go wash our hands, and burn our clothes.",3.0,2.0
Aang,"Thank you, sewer friends.",3.0,2.0
Li,"When tracking your brother and uncle, traveling with the royal procession may no longer be an option.",3.0,2.0
Lo,May no longer be wise.,3.0,2.0
Lo and Li,If you hope to keep the element of surprise.,3.0,2.0
Azula,"You're right. The Royal Procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I must be agile, nimble. I need a small, elite team. It's time to visit some old friends.",3.0,2.0
Katara,Let's find Bumi and get out of here.,3.0,2.0
Sokka,Where would they be keeping him?,3.0,2.0
Aang,Somewhere he can't earthbend. Somewhere made of metal.,3.0,2.0
Mai,There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place.,3.0,2.0

Azula,"I'm hunting a traitor.  You remember my old fuddy-duddy uncle, don't you?",3.0,2.0

Aang,"So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance?",3.0,2.0
Yung,"Of course not! The day of the invasion, we readied ourselves for battle. We were prepared to defend our city ... to fight for our lives and for our freedom. But before we even had a chance, King Bumi surrendered.",3.0,2.0

King Bumi,I'm going to do ... nothing! ,3.0,2.0
Yung,It doesn't matter now.  Fighting the Fire Nation is the only path to freedom.  And freedom is worth dying for.,3.0,2.0
Aang,"Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation.  But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day.",3.0,2.0
Yung,"You don't understand. They've taken our home, and we have to fight them at any cost! ",3.0,2.0

Aang," I don't understand. Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi?",3.0,2.0
King Bumi," Listen to me, Aang. There are options in fighting, called jing. It's a choice of how you direct your energy.",3.0,2.0
Aang," I know! There's positive jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating.",3.0,2.0
King Bumi, ... and neutral jing when you do nothing!,3.0,2.0
Aang, There are  three  jings?,3.0,2.0
King Bumi,"Well, technically there are eighty-five, but let's just focus on the third. Neutral jing is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike.",3.0,2.0
Aang," That's why you surrendered, isn't it?",3.0,2.0
King Bumi,"Yes, and it's why I can't leave now.",3.0,2.0
Aang, I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.,3.0,2.0
King Bumi,Your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jing. You need to find someone who waits and listens before striking.,3.0,2.0

Katara, Is something wrong?,4.0,2.0
Aang," I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me.",4.0,2.0
Sokka, Is it telling you where we can get something to eat?,4.0,2.0
Aang,"No, I ... I think it wants us to land there.",4.0,2.0
Sokka," No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.",4.0,2.0
Aang,"I don't know. Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it?",4.0,2.0
Sokka,Yes.,4.0,2.0
Katara,I don't know. There's something ominous about that place.,4.0,2.0
Sokka,"See, even Appa and Momo don't like it here.",4.0,2.0
Aang," Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this,  bye swamp.  Yip, Yip!",4.0,2.0

Aang," No, and the tornado ... it just disappeared.",4.0,2.0
Sokka, We better speed things up.,4.0,2.0
Aang, Maybe we should be a little nicer to the swamp.,4.0,2.0
Sokka," Aang, these are just plants. Do you want me to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" as I swing my machete back and forth?",4.0,2.0
Katara,Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels ...  alive.,4.0,2.0
Sokka,"I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can.",4.0,2.0
Katara, Appa! Momo!,4.0,2.0
Sokka,There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them. We'll have to make camp for the night.,4.0,2.0
Katara,What was that?,4.0,2.0
Sokka,"Nothing, just swamp gas.  Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here.",4.0,2.0
Sokka, I think we should build a fire.,4.0,2.0
Aang,"Sokka, the longer we're here, the more I think you shouldn't be doing do that.",4.0,2.0
Sokka,"No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine.  Right, swamp?  ""No problem, Sokka!""",4.0,2.0

Sokka, What do you guys think you're doing!? I've been looking all over for you!,4.0,2.0
Katara," Well, I've been wandering around looking for you!",4.0,2.0
Aang, I was chasing some girl.,4.0,2.0
Katara,What girl?,4.0,2.0
Aang, I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress.,4.0,2.0
Sokka," Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!",4.0,2.0
Katara,I thought I saw Mom.,4.0,2.0
Sokka,"Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here.",4.0,2.0
Katara, You saw something too?,4.0,2.0
Sokka," I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything. Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot.",4.0,2.0
Aang,What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here.,4.0,2.0
Katara,Okay ... so where's here? The middle of the swamp?,4.0,2.0
Aang,"Yeah, the center ... it's the heart of the swamp. It's been calling us here. I knew it.",4.0,2.0
Sokka,"It's just a tree.  It can't call anyone. For the last time, there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here.",4.0,2.0
Tho,"Now, what would a lemoo need a shirt fer?",4.0,2.0
Sokka,There's someone in there! He's bending the vines!,4.0,2.0
Aang, Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us!?,4.0,2.0
Huu,Wait!  I didn't call you here.,4.0,2.0
Aang," We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land.",4.0,2.0
Sokka,He's the Avatar. Stuff like that happens to us a lot.,4.0,2.0
Huu,The Avatar? Come with me.,4.0,2.0
Katara,"So, who are you then?",4.0,2.0
Huu," I protect the swamp from folks that want to hurt it, like this fella with his big knife.",4.0,2.0
Sokka,"See, completely reasonable.  Not a monster, just a regular guy defending his home. Nothing mystical about it.",4.0,2.0
Huu,"Oh the swamp is a mystical place all right. It's sacred. I reached enlightenment right here under the banyan-grove tree.  I heard it calling me, just like you did.",4.0,2.0
Sokka, Sure you did. It seems real chatty.,4.0,2.0
Huu," See this whole swamp is actually just one tree spread out over miles. Branches spread and sink, take root, and spread some more. One big, living organism. Just like the entire world.",4.0,2.0
Aang," I get how the tree is one big thing, but the whole world?",4.0,2.0
Huu,"Sure. You think you're any different from me or your friends or this tree? If you listen hard enough, you can hear every living thing breathing together.  You can feel everything growing. We're all living together, even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots and we are all branches of the same tree.",4.0,2.0
Katara, But what did our visions mean?,4.0,2.0
Huu,"In the swamp, we see visions of people we've lost, people we loved, folks we think are gone.  But the swamp tells us they're not. We're still connected to them. Time is an illusion and so is death.",4.0,2.0
Aang,But what about my vision? It was someone I had never met.,4.0,2.0
Huu,You're the Avatar. You tell me.,4.0,2.0
Aang," Time is an illusion. So, it's someone I will meet.",4.0,2.0
Sokka,"Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to find Appa and Momo.",4.0,2.0
Aang,I think I know how to find them.  Everything is connected.  Come on! We've got to hurry!,4.0,2.0
Tho, Set my lines by the river bed! Caught ten fish and I killed 'em dead! Cut 'em and gut 'em and I tossed the heads in the water to keep them catgators fed.,4.0,2.0
Aang,Appa!,4.0,2.0
Due,We're under attack!,4.0,2.0
Katara,"Hey, you guys are waterbenders!",4.0,2.0
Due,You too! That means we're kin!  Hey Huu! How you been?,4.0,2.0
Huu,"You know, scared some folks, swung some vines, the usual.",4.0,2.0
Sokka,Huu?,4.0,2.0
Due,How you like that possum chicken?,4.0,2.0
Sokka,Tastes just like arctic hen. So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa?  You've got plenty of those big things wandering around.,4.0,2.0
Due,You want me to eat old Slim? He's like a member of the family!,4.0,2.0
Sokka,Nice Slim!,4.0,2.0
Due," Oh, he don't eat no bugs! That's people food.",4.0,2.0
Tho,Where'd you say you was from?,4.0,2.0
Katara, The South Pole.,4.0,2.0
Tho,"Didn't know there was waterbenders anywhere but here. They got a nice swamp there, do they?",4.0,2.0
Katara,"No, it's all ice and snow.",4.0,2.0
Tho,Hmm. No wonder you left.,4.0,2.0
Sokka," Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here.  Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp.",4.0,2.0
Katara,What about the visions?,4.0,2.0
Sokka,"I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug!",4.0,2.0
Aang, But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?,4.0,2.0
Sokka,"That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count.  The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down.",4.0,2.0
Huu,I can't do anything like that. I just bend the water in the plants.,4.0,2.0
Sokka,"Well, no accounting for weather. Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp.",4.0,2.0
Broadsword man,Who's there?,4.0,2.0
Sokka," What are you doing in my mouth?  Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.",5.0,2.0

Katara, There's no time!,5.0,2.0
Sokka," Oh, I see,  so there's time to get your scrolls  and time to get your staff,  but no time for my boomerang?",5.0,2.0
Katara, That's correct!,5.0,2.0
Sokka, Oh.,5.0,2.0
Aang," Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.",5.0,2.0

Villager #2, We used to be a great society before you killed our leader.  Now look at us!,5.0,2.0
Aang, Huh!,5.0,2.0
Katara, Aang would never do something like that. No Avatar would.  And it's not fair for you all to question his honor!,5.0,2.0
Villager #3," Let's tell her what we all think of the Avatar's ""honor""!",5.0,2.0
Aang,Give me a chance to clear my name!,5.0,2.0

Tong,You'll have to follow all our rules. That includes paying bail.,5.0,2.0
Aang,No problem.,5.0,2.0
Aang, How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?,5.0,2.0

Sokka, Sure you can! A little  swish-swish-swish!  Airbending slice!  And we're on our way!,5.0,2.0
Katara," I think what ""Master Swish"" is trying to say  is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here.",5.0,2.0
Aang, I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence.,5.0,2.0
Sokka,How're we gonna to do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago.,5.0,2.0
Aang," That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective.",5.0,2.0
Sokka," Well, I guess I could be classified as such.",5.0,2.0
Katara," Yeah! Back home, he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky.",5.0,2.0
Sokka," Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots!  See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks.  Okay, I guess I am pretty good.",5.0,2.0
Aang,"So, you'll help me with my case?",5.0,2.0
Sokka, Fine! But I'm going to need some new props.  I'm ready.  What?,5.0,2.0
Tong,"This is the crime scene.  This is the footprint of the killer, Kyoshi.  It was at sunset, 370 years ago today, that she emerged from the temple, and struck down Chin the Great. After that tragic day, we built this statue to immortalize our great leader.  Feel free to appreciate it.",5.0,2.0
Sokka,This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone.  And we know that the statue was built after Chin died.,5.0,2.0
Katara," So if they were built at the same time, that means–",5.0,2.0
Sokka, Shhh! I wanna solve it!  That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple!,5.0,2.0
Katara,"That's a big hole in the mayor's story,  but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence.",5.0,2.0
Sokka,You're right.  We need to go to Kyoshi Island.,5.0,2.0
Katara, Where did you get that?,5.0,2.0
Scary prisoner,You got a bald head.  Some nice tattoos.  You're going to fit in real well around here.,5.0,2.0
Koko, Where's Aangy?,5.0,2.0
Katara," He couldn't be here, Koko.",5.0,2.0
Koko, I wanted to see Aangy ...,5.0,2.0
Katara,Oyaji! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life.,5.0,2.0
Sokka,They say it was Kyoshi.,5.0,2.0
Oyaji, Kyoshi? That's crazy talk! I'll take you to her shrine. Maybe something there will help you clear her name.,5.0,2.0
Sokka," So, uh ... what's Suki up to? Is she around?",5.0,2.0
Oyaji,"Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war. You kids had a big impact on Suki. She said you inspired her and she wanted to help change the world.",5.0,2.0
Sokka," Oh, well ... that's great.",5.0,2.0
Oyaji,This temple was converted into a shrine to Kyoshi. The clerics tell us these relics are still connected to her spirit. That's her kimono.,5.0,2.0
Katara, She had exquisite taste.,5.0,2.0
Oyaji,Please don't touch!,5.0,2.0
Sokka,"These fans ...  They were her weapons, no?",5.0,2.0
Oyaji, Also refrain from touching the fans.,5.0,2.0
Katara, These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!,5.0,2.0
Oyaji, The biggest of any Avatar.,5.0,2.0
Katara, Wait a minute ... big feet?  Little footprint?  There's no way–,5.0,2.0
Sokka, Special outfit? Hat and pipe? These things mean anything to you?,5.0,2.0
Katara, You're right. I'm sorry.  Please.,5.0,2.0
Sokka, Aha!  There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint.  And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene.,5.0,2.0
Katara," Brilliant, Sokka. ",5.0,2.0
Scary prisoner, This girl you're talking about? She'll come around. You just gotta hang in there.,5.0,2.0

Sokka," Three hundred and seventy years? Wait,  are you sure it was today?",5.0,2.0
Oyaji,"Oh, seeing how it's Kyoshi Day, yes,  I'm sure.",5.0,2.0
Sokka, This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise. It took place at sun  set  .  Look at the shadows.,5.0,2.0
Katara,They point east. So the sun must have been in the west.,5.0,2.0
Oyaji,So what?,5.0,2.0
Sokka," If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime. She has an alibi! ",5.0,2.0
Katara,"Honorable Mayor, we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar. We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence.",5.0,2.0
Tong,Evidence?  Hmph! That's not how our court system works.,5.0,2.0
Aang,Then how can I prove my innocence?,5.0,2.0
Tong,"Simple. I say what happened , then you say what happened, and then I decide who's right.  That's why we call it justice. Because it's ""just us.""",5.0,2.0
Tong," Everyone loved Chin the Great because he was so great. Then the Avatar showed up and killed him, and that's how it happened.",5.0,2.0
Guard, The accused will now present its argument.,5.0,2.0

Aang, Right ... evidence.  Ladies and gentlemen ... I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one.  Uhhh ...,5.0,2.0
Sokka, The footprint!,5.0,2.0

Sokka, He's dead.,5.0,2.0
Iroh,Looks like you did some serious shopping.  But where did you get the money?,5.0,2.0
Zuko, Do you like your new teapot?,5.0,2.0
Iroh,"To be honest with you , the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.  I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by.  But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.",5.0,2.0
Zuko,There's no honor for me without the Avatar.,5.0,2.0
Iroh,"Zuko ...  Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now.",5.0,2.0
Zuko, Then there is no hope at all.,5.0,2.0
Iroh,"No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts.  In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.",5.0,2.0
Katara,"Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony.",5.0,2.0
Tong,"I've already told you, it's just me and the accused. You can't call any witnesses!",5.0,2.0

Sokka, What are you doing?,5.0,2.0
Katara," Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something.",5.0,2.0
Sokka, I do believe in the power of stuff.,5.0,2.0
Tong, This is a mockery of Chin Law!,5.0,2.0
Katara," Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here!",5.0,2.0
Aang," Hey, everybody! Avatar Kyoshi here. ",5.0,2.0

Azula,The Avatar's trying to give us the slip.  You two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison.  I'll follow this trail.,8.0,2.0
Sokka," Toph couldn't have made it too far.  What is it, Momo? Ooooh, no! Katara!",8.0,2.0
Katara, How did they find us?,8.0,2.0
Sokka," Appa, come on, we need to go faster!",8.0,2.0
Katara,He's too tired!,8.0,2.0
Sokka," Not good, not good!  We just need to make it across that river!",8.0,2.0
Katara," Come on Appa, just a little further ...",8.0,2.0
Sokka, We made it! We're safe.,8.0,2.0
Katara, You did it Appa!,8.0,2.0
Sokka," Good try, but no.",8.0,2.0
Sokka,How are you doing?,8.0,2.0
Katara," Well, you know ...",8.0,2.0
Mai," I thought when Ty Lee and I finally caught you guys, it would be more exciting. Oh well, victory is boring.",8.0,2.0
Sokka," Thanks Appa, I don't know what we'd do without you.",8.0,2.0
Ty Lee," Was it just me, or was that guy kind of cute?",8.0,2.0
Aang,"All right, you've caught up with me. Now, who are you and what do you want?",8.0,2.0
Azula," You mean you haven't guessed? You don't see the family resemblance? Here's a hint.  I must find the Avatar to restore my honor!  It's okay, you can laugh. It's funny.",8.0,2.0
Aang,So what now?,8.0,2.0
Azula," Now? Now, it's over. You're tired and you have no place to go.  You can run, but I'll catch you.",8.0,2.0
Aang, I'm not running.,8.0,2.0
Iroh, Here is your tea.  You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.,8.0,2.0
Toph, You seem a little too old.,8.0,2.0
Iroh, Perhaps I am.,8.0,2.0
Toph, I know what you're thinking ... I look like I can't handle being by myself.,8.0,2.0
Iroh,I wasn't thinking that.,8.0,2.0
Toph,You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea!,8.0,2.0
Iroh,I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.,8.0,2.0
Toph,"People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me, but I can take care of myself, by myself.",8.0,2.0
Iroh,"You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you. Not that I love you, I just met you.",8.0,2.0
Toph, So where is your nephew?,8.0,2.0
Iroh,I've been tracking him actually.,8.0,2.0
Toph,Is he lost?,8.0,2.0
Iroh," Yes, a little bit.  His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He's trying to figure out who he is and he went away.",8.0,2.0
Toph,So now you're following him.,8.0,2.0
Iroh,"I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there.",8.0,2.0
Toph,"Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it.  Thank you.",8.0,2.0
Iroh,My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.,8.0,2.0
Toph," No, thank you for what you said. It helped me.",8.0,2.0
Iroh,I'm glad.,8.0,2.0
Toph," Oh, and about your nephew, maybe you should tell him that you need him, too.",8.0,2.0
Azula,Do you really want to fight me?,8.0,2.0
Zuko,"Yes, I really do.",8.0,2.0
Aang, Zuko!,8.0,2.0

Azula, I'm not going anywhere.,8.0,2.0
Aang, Katara!,8.0,2.0
Zuko, Uncle ...,8.0,2.0
Iroh,Get up!,8.0,2.0
Toph,I thought you guys could use a little help.,8.0,2.0
Katara, Thanks.,8.0,2.0
Azula," Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors, all working together. I'm done.  I know when I'm beaten. You got me. A princess surrenders with honor.",8.0,2.0
Zuko, Aaaah!,8.0,2.0
Zuko, Ugggh!  Get away from us!,8.0,2.0
Katara,"Zuko, I can help.",8.0,2.0
Zuko, Leave!,8.0,2.0
Aang,"Today's the day!  Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending!  And this place,  it's perfect, don't you think? Sokka?  Oh, you're still sleeping, huh?  Sorry.",9.0,2.0
Toph,"Goooood morning,  earthbending student!",9.0,2.0
Aang,"Good morning, Sifu Toph.",9.0,2.0
Katara," Hey, you never called me Sifu Katara.",9.0,2.0
Aang," Well, if you think I should ...",9.0,2.0
Toph,"Sorry, Snoozles, we'll do our earthbending as  quietly as we can.",9.0,2.0
Aang," So what move are you going to teach me first?  Rock-a-lanche?  The Trembler? Oh, maybe I could learn to make a  whirlpool out of land!",9.0,2.0
Toph, Let's start with ...  move a rock.,9.0,2.0
Aang," Sounds good, sounds good!",9.0,2.0
Toph,"The key to earthbending is your stance. You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element. If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself.",9.0,2.0
Aang,Like a rock. Got it.,9.0,2.0
Toph,"Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple.  Okay, you ready to give it a try?",9.0,2.0
Aang,I'm ready. ,9.0,2.0
Sokka, Rock beats airbender!,9.0,2.0
Lu Ten,"I got you, Dad! ",9.0,2.0
Iroh,"My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.",9.0,2.0
Zuko,Uncle ... you were unconscious. Azula did this to you. It was a surprise attack.,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Somehow, that's not so surprising. ",9.0,2.0
Zuko, I hope I made it the way you like it. ,9.0,2.0
Iroh, Good. That was very ... uhhh ... bracing. ,9.0,2.0
Zuko,"So Uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her.",9.0,2.0
Iroh," No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down.  It's time to resume your training.",9.0,2.0
Katara,I don't understand what went wrong. He did it exactly the way you did.,9.0,2.0
Aang,Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle?,9.0,2.0
Toph,"No. That's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickety-trick that's going to move that rock. You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this ... ",9.0,2.0
Aang,Whoa!,9.0,2.0
Katara," I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction.",9.0,2.0
Toph,"Thanks, Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that.  Keep your knees high, Twinkle Toes!",9.0,2.0
Toph,Rock-like!,9.0,2.0
Toph,Rock-like!,9.0,2.0
Sokka,"You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat. Just a bit closer ...  Gotcha!  You are one lucky little meat creature.",9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.",9.0,2.0
Zuko,"I see. That's why we're drinking tea, to calm the mind.",9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes.  There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning. ",9.0,2.0
Zuko,I'm ready to try it!,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.",9.0,2.0
Toph,"This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. Get in your horse stance! I'm going to roll that boulder down at you. If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock. Like this! ",9.0,2.0
Katara,"Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?",9.0,2.0
Toph,"I'm glad you said something. Actually there is a better way.  This way, you'll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara.",9.0,2.0
Aang," Yeah, thanks, Katara!",9.0,2.0
Katara, Heh.,9.0,2.0
Aang,I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.,9.0,2.0
Toph,"There's nothing to say, you blew it! You had a perfect stance, and a perfect form. But when it came right down to it, you didn't have the guts!",9.0,2.0
Aang, I know. I'm sorry.,9.0,2.0
Toph,"Yeah, you  are  sorry! If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender?",9.0,2.0
Aang,"No, I don't think I do.",9.0,2.0
Katara,"Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on. Okay?",9.0,2.0
Aang,"Yeah, that sounds good.",9.0,2.0
Toph,"Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better.",9.0,2.0
Zuko,Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face ... like everything always does.,9.0,2.0
Iroh,I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.,9.0,2.0
Zuko,What turmoil?,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.",9.0,2.0
Zuko,But I don't feel any shame at all. I'm as proud as ever.,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.",9.0,2.0
Zuko,"Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately.",9.0,2.0
Iroh,"I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself. ",9.0,2.0
Sokka,"You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute. Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty.  Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off! That's okay, I got it.  Now, come back boomerang.",9.0,2.0
Katara,"You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?",9.0,2.0
Aang,I don't want to talk about it.,9.0,2.0
Katara,"You do realize that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it–",9.0,2.0
Aang," I know, I know, I know, I know! I get it, all right? I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't, but I can't.",9.0,2.0
Katara,"Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?",9.0,2.0
Aang,I guess it's earth.,9.0,2.0
Katara,That's why it's so difficult for you to get this. You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will. Think fast!  Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.,9.0,2.0
Aang,"Thanks, Katara.  Sifu  Katara. ",9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Fire is the element of power.  The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance.  The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom.  The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!  Water is the element of change.  The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.",9.0,2.0
Zuko,Why are you telling me these things?,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.  Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole. ",9.0,2.0
Zuko,All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But it can make you more powerful, too. You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.",9.0,2.0
Toph,"Aang, I found these nuts in your bag. I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it.",9.0,2.0
Aang,"As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have.",9.0,2.0
Toph,"You know, I'm really glad you feel that way. Because I also have this great new nutcracker.",9.0,2.0
Aang,"Actually, I prefer if you didn't ...  That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ...  It's a delicate instrument!",9.0,2.0
Toph,It's not the only delicate instrument around here. ,9.0,2.0
Aang, Ohm.,9.0,2.0
Katara,"Hey Aang, have you seen–",9.0,2.0
Aang, Meditating here!,9.0,2.0
Katara,It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.,9.0,2.0
Aang,We'll find him faster if we split up. ,9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay?  Ow! That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal?  Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat?",9.0,2.0
Aang,Sokka! Are you okay? ,9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!",9.0,2.0
Aang,Hmmm ... I bet I can airbend you out of here. ,9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?",9.0,2.0
Aang,I can't ... I can't do it.,9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph.",9.0,2.0
Aang,I can't do that either.,9.0,2.0
Sokka,You can't? Why not?,9.0,2.0
Aang,It would just be really ... uncomfortable.,9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Uncomfortable?  Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ...",9.0,2.0
Aang,"Thanks, Sokka. This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position.",9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Awkward position, I think I know the feeling.",9.0,2.0
Aang,"If I try, I fail. If I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.",9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Hmmm ... how about that. Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.",9.0,2.0
Aang,"Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub.",9.0,2.0
Sokka,Really? He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion.,9.0,2.0
Aang,It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. What are you doing out here little guy? Did you lose your mama?,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning.",9.0,2.0
Zuko,You can teach me to redirect lightning?,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean.  From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this.  Now, are you focusing your energy? Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?",9.0,2.0
Zuko,I think so.,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Come on, you've got to feel the flow.  Excellent! You've got it!",9.0,2.0
Zuko,"Great, I'm ready to try it with real lightning!",9.0,2.0
Iroh,"What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous!",9.0,2.0
Zuko,I thought that was the point! You teaching me to protect myself from it!,9.0,2.0
Iroh,"Yeah! But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!",9.0,2.0
Zuko,"Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning. ",9.0,2.0
Aang,"Hey there, we found your cub! See, we have no problem with you! We're friendly!",9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Aang, this is bad, you've got to get me out of here!",9.0,2.0
Sokka,"This is really bad! Please Aang, you have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!",9.0,2.0
Aang,"Oh no!  Woo-hoo, look at me!",9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Please, don't leave me again.",9.0,2.0
Aang,I won't.,9.0,2.0
Sokka,What are you doing here?,9.0,2.0
Toph,Just enjoying the show.,9.0,2.0
Aang,What? You were there the whole time?,9.0,2.0
Toph,Pretty much.,9.0,2.0
Aang,Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could have gotten him out and helped us get away!,9.0,2.0
Toph,Guess it just didn't occur to me. ,9.0,2.0
Aang, Enough! I want my staff back! ,9.0,2.0
Toph,Do it now!,9.0,2.0
Aang,What?,9.0,2.0
Toph,"Earthbend, Twinkle Toes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast. And even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got stuff.",9.0,2.0
Aang,But–,9.0,2.0
Toph,Do it!,9.0,2.0
Toph,You did it! You're an earthbender.,9.0,2.0
Aang,I can't believe it!,9.0,2.0
Sokka," Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment. So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?",9.0,2.0
Aang,"No problem, Sokka!",9.0,2.0
Toph,"Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. You might accidentally crush him.",9.0,2.0
Sokka,"Yeah, no crushing, please.",9.0,2.0
Katara,You found him! ,9.0,2.0
Sokka,"The whole time, I was in that hole, not knowing if I was going to live or die. It makes a man to think about what's really important. I realized–",9.0,2.0
Aang," Hey Katara, look what I can do! ",9.0,2.0
Katara,"You did it! I knew you would!  You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?",9.0,2.0
Toph," Yep, it worked wonders.",9.0,2.0
Aang,"Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted. Physically and mentally unmovable!",9.0,2.0

Toph," A lot, actually. There's hundreds of little ...",10.0,2.0

Sokka," This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans.",10.0,2.0
Toph,We  did  make plans. We're all picking mini-vacations.,10.0,2.0
Sokka,There's no time for vacations.,10.0,2.0
Aang,I'm learning the elements as fast as I can. I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrow off!,10.0,2.0
Katara," Yeah, what's wrong with having a little fun in our down time?",10.0,2.0
Sokka,"Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the Fire Nation.  Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house?  Knock, knock. Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war.",10.0,2.0
Katara," All right, we'll finish our vacations and  then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence. ",10.0,2.0
Aang," Your turn, Katara. Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?",10.0,2.0
Katara, How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.,10.0,2.0
Aang,"Oh, yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring. And I usually don't use the word ""pristine"".  It's one of nature's wonders.",10.0,2.0

Zei, You're a living relic.,10.0,2.0
Aang," Thanks, I try.",10.0,2.0
Zei,"An Air Nomad, right in front of me.  Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University.  Tell me, which of the air temples do you hail from?",10.0,2.0
Aang,The Southern Temple.,10.0,2.0
Zei," Oh, splendid! Now tell me- what was the primary agricultural product of your people?",10.0,2.0
Aang," Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?",10.0,2.0
Zei,"Oh, truly fascinating. That is one for the journal. ",10.0,2.0
Sokka,"So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated.",10.0,2.0
Zei,Certainly.,10.0,2.0
Sokka,"What, no Fire Nation?  Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?",10.0,2.0
Katara, You've made a lot of trips into the desert.,10.0,2.0
Zei,"All in vain, I'm afraid. I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom,  but I haven't managed to find the crown jewel: Wan Shi Tong's Library. ",10.0,2.0
Toph, You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library?,10.0,2.0
Zei,"This library is more valuable than gold, little lady. It is said to contain a vast collection of knowledge, and knowledge is priceless.",10.0,2.0
Toph," Hmm, sounds like good times.",10.0,2.0
Zei,"Oh, it is. According to legend, it was built by the great Knowledge Spirit, Wan Shi Tong, with the help of his ""foxy"" knowledge seekers.",10.0,2.0
Sokka," Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?",10.0,2.0
Katara," I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.",10.0,2.0
Zei,"You're both right.  Handsome little creatures.  Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge seekers collected books from all over the world, and put them on display for mankind to read, so that we might better ourselves.",10.0,2.0
Sokka,"If this place has books from all over the world,  do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map, maybe?",10.0,2.0
Zei,"I wouldn't know. But if such a thing exists, it's in Wan Shi Tong's Library.",10.0,2.0
Sokka,"Then it's settled. Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation  at the library! ",10.0,2.0
Toph," Uh, hey, what about me? When do I get to pick?",10.0,2.0

Toph, Does this place even exist?,10.0,2.0
Zei,Some say it doesn't.,10.0,2.0
Toph, Shouldn't you have mentioned that before? ,10.0,2.0
Toph, There it is!  That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it. ,10.0,2.0
Katara,"It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant, ornate building from the air.",10.0,2.0
Sokka," Down there, what's that?",10.0,2.0
Katara, Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for.  The building in this drawing is enormous.,10.0,2.0
Sokka, What kind of animal is that?,10.0,2.0
Zei,"I think that was one of the Knowledge Seekers.  Oh, we must be close to the library!",10.0,2.0
Sokka," No, this is the library- look!  It's completely buried.",10.0,2.0
Zei," The library is buried?!  My life's ambition is now full of sand.  Well, time to start excavating. ",10.0,2.0
Toph," Actually, that won't be necessary. The inside seems to be completely intact.  And it's huge.",10.0,2.0
Sokka,That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look.,10.0,2.0
Toph,I say you guys go ahead without me.,10.0,2.0

Aang,What do you have against humans?,10.0,2.0
Wan Shi Tong,"Hm! Humans only bother learning things to get the edge on other humans.  Like that firebender who came to this place a few years ago, looking to destroy his enemy.  So ...  who are you trying to destroy?",10.0,2.0

Sokka, Bright enough to fool you.,10.0,2.0
Toph," So ... you like ... flying?  Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground where I can see. Well, I don't  see  the way you do. I feel the vibrations in the ground with my feet.

Aang, Firebenders.,10.0,2.0
Katara,They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation.,10.0,2.0

Aang," Great, you must have broken it.",10.0,2.0
Sokka," It's not broken.  The sun is behind the moon. It's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it.  Something awful happened on that day. I don't know what, but I do know why. Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse.  Sorry.",10.0,2.0
Katara,"That makes sense. I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge.",10.0,2.0
Sokka," Fine, you earned it.  We've gotta get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is going down!",10.0,2.0
Wan Shi Tong," Mortals are so predictable, and such terrible liars.  You betrayed my trust. From the beginning, you intended to misuse this knowledge for evil purposes.",10.0,2.0
Sokka,"You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information.",10.0,2.0
Wan Shi Tong,You think you're the first person to believe their war was justified? Countless others before you have come here seeking weapons or weaknesses or battle strategies.,10.0,2.0

Toph,What is it now?,10.0,2.0
Toph, Who's there?,10.0,2.0
Aang,Why are we doing this?,10.0,2.0
Sokka,"Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be.",10.0,2.0
Aang,You can't possibly check every single date.,10.0,2.0

Aang," Come on, eclipse.",10.0,2.0
Sokka,"That's it! The solar eclipse! It's just a few months away.  Got it. Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.",10.0,2.0

Sokka,"Wait! Professor, let's go.",10.0,2.0
Zei, I'm not leaving. I can't.  I've spent too long trying to find this place.  There's not another collection of knowledge like this on earth.  I could spend an eternity in here.,10.0,2.0

Xin Fu,You seen these guys‌?,11.0,2.0
Sha-Mo,"What are you doing in our land with a sandbender sailer? ‌ From the looks of it, you stole it from the Hami tribe.",11.0,2.0
Katara,We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We're traveling with the Avatar.  Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba Sing Se.,11.0,2.0
Ghashiun,You dare accuse our people of theft while you ride in on a stolen sand sailer‌?!,11.0,2.0
Sha-Mo,"Quiet, Ghashiun. No one accused our people of anything. If what they say is true, we must give them hospitality.",11.0,2.0
Ghashiun,"Sorry, father.",11.0,2.0
Toph,I recognize the son's voice. He's the one that stole Appa.,11.0,2.0

Toph,I never forget a voice.,11.0,2.0

Ghashiun, I traded him! To some merchants! He's probably in Ba Sing Se by now! They were going to sell him there!  Please! We'll escort you out of the desert! We'll help however we can!,11.0,2.0
Sokka,Just get out of here! Run!,11.0,2.0
Katara, Waterbending bomb! Yeah! ,12.0,2.0
Sokka," Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library. Just splash some water on 'em.",12.0,2.0
Katara,Sorry. ,12.0,2.0
Aang,"So, did you figure out what route we're going to take?",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here. And we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here. It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass.",12.0,2.0
Toph,You sure that's the best way to go?,12.0,2.0
Sokka,"It's the only way. I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.",12.0,2.0
Katara, Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be sensitive?,12.0,2.0
Aang,"Katara, it's okay. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse.",12.0,2.0
Katara," Oh ... well, okay. I'm glad you're doing better.",12.0,2.0

Katara,Great! We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.,12.0,2.0
Ying,The Serpent's Pass? Only the truly desperate take that deadly route!,12.0,2.0
Toph,"Deadly route.  Great pick, Sokka!",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"Well, we are desperate.",12.0,2.0
Than,You should come with us to Full Moon Bay. Ferries take refugees across the lake. It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se.,12.0,2.0
Ying,"And it's hidden, so the Fire Nation can't find it.",12.0,2.0
Katara,Hmm ... peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass?,12.0,2.0

Smellerbee,Hey. ,12.0,2.0
Zuko,Hello.,12.0,2.0
Jet,"Here's the deal. I hear the captain's eating like a king while the refugees have to feed off his scraps. Doesn't seem fair, does it?",12.0,2.0
Iroh,What sort of king is he eating like?,12.0,2.0
Jet,"The fat, happy kind.  You want to help us ""liberate"" some food?",12.0,2.0
Zuko, I'm in.,12.0,2.0
Ticket lady,I told you already ... no vegetables on the ferry! One cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se! Security!,12.0,2.0

Ticket lady,Next!,12.0,2.0
Aang,"Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.",12.0,2.0
Ticket lady,Passports?,12.0,2.0
Aang,Uh ... no one told us we had to have passports.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar!,12.0,2.0
Ticket lady,"Ah, I see fifty Avatars a day and, by the way, not a very impressive costume.  Besides, no animals allowed. Do I need to call security?",12.0,2.0
Aang,That won't be necessary.,12.0,2.0
Ticket lady,Next!,12.0,2.0

Toph,-is my seeing-eye lemur.,12.0,2.0
Ticket lady,"Well, normally it's only one ticket per passport, but this document is so official ... I guess it's worth four tickets. ",12.0,2.0
Toph,Thank you very much.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,"All right, we scammed that lady good!",12.0,2.0
Suki,Tickets and passports please.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,Is there a problem?,12.0,2.0
Suki,"Yeah, I got a problem with you! I've seen your type before. Probably sarcastic, think you're hilarious and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.",12.0,2.0
Sokka,Do I know you?,12.0,2.0
Suki,You mean you don't remember? Maybe you'll remember this! ,12.0,2.0
Sokka,Suki! ,12.0,2.0
Suki,"Sokka, it's good to see you!",12.0,2.0
Katara,You look so different without your makeup! And the new outfit.,12.0,2.0
Suki,"That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them. And look at you, sleeveless guy. Been working out?",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing major.",12.0,2.0
Aang,Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around?,12.0,2.0
Suki,"Yeah. After you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up escorting some refugees and we've been here ever since.  Hi, Momo! Good to see you too!  So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry? Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?",12.0,2.0
Katara,Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.,12.0,2.0
Suki,I'm so sorry to hear that.  Are you doing okay?,12.0,2.0
Aang,I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me?,12.0,2.0
Ying,"Avatar Aang, you have to help us! Someone took all of our belongings; our passports, our tickets, everything's gone!",12.0,2.0
Aang,I'll talk to the lady for you.,12.0,2.0
Ticket lady,"No passports, no tickets! ",12.0,2.0
Aang,But she's pregnant and all of her stuff was stolen! You have to make an exception!,12.0,2.0
Ticket lady,"No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy-nilly to anyone, there would be no more order! You know what that means, no more civilization!",12.0,2.0
Aang,What if we gave them our tickets?,12.0,2.0
Ticket lady,No!,12.0,2.0
Aang,But ...,12.0,2.0
Ticket lady,Next!,12.0,2.0
Aang,"Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass.",12.0,2.0
Sokka,I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.,12.0,2.0
Toph,I can't believe you're still complaining about it.,12.0,2.0
Suki, I'm coming too!,12.0,2.0
Sokka,Are you sure that's a good idea?,12.0,2.0
Suki,"Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come.",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"I do, it's just–",12.0,2.0
Suki,Just what?,12.0,2.0
Sokka,Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,"This is the Serpent's Pass? I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent. Huh, I guess they misnamed it.",12.0,2.0
Ying,Look at this writing! How awful!,12.0,2.0
Toph,What does it say?,12.0,2.0
Katara,"It says, ""abandon hope"".",12.0,2.0
Ying,How can we abandon hope? It's all we have!,12.0,2.0
Aang,"I don't know. The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it.",12.0,2.0
Katara,What are you talking about?,12.0,2.0
Aang,Hope is not going to get us into Ba Sing Se and it's not going to help find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now and that's getting across this path.,12.0,2.0
Katara,"Okay, if you say so.",12.0,2.0
Suki,The Fire Nation controls the western lake. Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other side of it and don't want anyone to find out what it is.,12.0,2.0
Than,I'm okay! ,12.0,2.0
Sokka,"They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go!",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"Suki, are you okay? You have to be more careful! Come on!",12.0,2.0
Toph," ""Thanks for saving my life, Toph."" Hey, no problem, Sokka.",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"Suki, you shouldn't sleep there. Who knows how stable this ledge is, it could give away at any moment! ",12.0,2.0
Suki,"Sokka, I'm fine, stop worrying!",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"You're right, you're right, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself! Wait! Oh, never mind, I thought I saw a spider, but, you're fine.",12.0,2.0
Smellerbee,Guard's coming!,12.0,2.0
Katara,"You know, it's okay to miss Appa.  What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all.",12.0,2.0
Aang,You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that.,12.0,2.0
Katara,"But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.  Come on, you need a hug.",12.0,2.0
Aang," Thank you for your concern, Katara. ",12.0,2.0
Suki,It's a beautiful moon.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,"Yeah, it really is.",12.0,2.0
Suki,"Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself.",12.0,2.0
Sokka,I know you can.,12.0,2.0
Suki,Then why are you acting so overprotective?,12.0,2.0
Sokka,It's so hard to lose someone you care about. Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.,12.0,2.0
Suki,"I lost someone I care about. He didn't die, he just went away. I only had a few days to get to know him, but he was smart and brave and funny ...",12.0,2.0
Sokka, Who is this guy? Is he taller than me?,12.0,2.0
Suki,"No, he's about your height.",12.0,2.0
Sokka,Is he better-looking?,12.0,2.0
Suki,"It  is  you, stupid!",12.0,2.0
Sokka,Oh!,12.0,2.0
Sokka,I can't.,12.0,2.0
Suki,I'm sorry.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,"No, you shouldn't be. ",12.0,2.0
Iroh,"So, Smellerbee. That's an unusual name for a young man.",12.0,2.0
Smellerbee,Maybe it's because I'm not a man ... I'm a girl! ,12.0,2.0
Iroh," Oh, now I see. It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!",12.0,2.0
Smellerbee,"I know, you're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think. Thanks, Longshot.",12.0,2.0
Jet,"From what I heard, people eat like this every night in Ba Sing Se. I can't wait to set my eyes on that giant wall.",12.0,2.0
Iroh,It is a magnificent sight.,12.0,2.0
Jet,So you've been there before?,12.0,2.0
Iroh,Once. When I was a ... different man.,12.0,2.0
Jet,"I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of, but that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se: for a new beginning. A second chance.",12.0,2.0
Iroh,That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances.,12.0,2.0
Katara,"Everyone single file!  Aang, I need help! ",12.0,2.0
Katara,What is that thing?,12.0,2.0
Sokka,"I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass! Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away!",12.0,2.0
Suki,Just because I live near the unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert!,12.0,2.0
Sokka," Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you.",12.0,2.0
Katara,Sokka!,12.0,2.0
Aang," I'll distract it. Katara, get everyone across! ",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"Toph, come on, it's just ice!",12.0,2.0
Toph," Actually, I'm going to stay on my little island, where I can see!  Okay, I'm coming! ",12.0,2.0
Sokka,You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice!,12.0,2.0
Toph,It's hard to ignore.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,You're almost there!,12.0,2.0
Toph,Help! I can't swim!,12.0,2.0
Sokka,"I'm coming, Toph!",12.0,2.0
Toph,Help!,12.0,2.0
Toph," Oh Sokka, you saved me! ",12.0,2.0
Suki,"Actually, it's me.",12.0,2.0
Toph,Oh ... well ...  you can go ahead and let me drown now.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,There's the wall! Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.,12.0,2.0
Ying, Oh no!,12.0,2.0
Sokka,What's wrong?,12.0,2.0
Ying,The baby's coming!,12.0,2.0
Sokka, What? Now? Can't you hold it in or something?,12.0,2.0
Katara,"Sokka, calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home.",12.0,2.0
Sokka,This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real ... human ... thing!,12.0,2.0
Katara,"It's called a baby and I helped her deliver plenty of those, too. Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water. Toph, I need you to make an earth tent, a big one.  Suki, come with me.",12.0,2.0
Jet,"You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were. You're an outcast, like me. And us outcasts have to stick together. We have to watch each other's backs. Because no one else will.",12.0,2.0
Zuko,I've realized lately that being on your own isn't always the best path.,12.0,2.0
Katara,"You're doing great, Ying. Sokka, where's that water? Now get ready to push. One ... two ...  ... three, push!",12.0,2.0
Katara, It's a girl!,12.0,2.0
Toph,"So, you want to go see the baby, or are you going to faint like an old lady again?",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"No, no, I'm good this time. ",12.0,2.0
Katara,"Aang, you have to come see this.",12.0,2.0
Toph,She sounds healthy.,12.0,2.0
Katara,She's beautiful.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,It's so ... squishy looking.,12.0,2.0
Than,What should we name her?,12.0,2.0
Ying,I want our daughter's name to be unique. I want it to mean something.,12.0,2.0
Aang, I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me ... hopeful again.,12.0,2.0
Ying,I know what I want to name our baby now. Hope.,12.0,2.0
Than,That's a perfect name. Hope.,12.0,2.0
Aang,"I thought I was trying to be strong. But really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you.",12.0,2.0
Aang,"I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can. I just really need to do this.",12.0,2.0
Sokka,See you in the big city.,12.0,2.0
Toph,Say hi to that big fuzzball for me. ,12.0,2.0
Katara,"You'll find him, Aang.",12.0,2.0

Suki,"Sokka, it's been really great to see you again.",12.0,2.0
Sokka,"Whoa, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?",12.0,2.0
Suki,I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the Serpent's Pass safely. But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi Warriors.,12.0,2.0
Sokka,So you came along to protect me?,12.0,2.0
Suki,"Listen, I'm really sorry about last night. We were talking ... and saying things ... and I just got carried away and before I knew it -",12.0,2.0
Sokka, You talk too much.,12.0,2.0

Qin,"This drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power. Once it tunnels through the wall, our troops will storm their city. The Earth Kingdom will finally fall, and you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father. Nothing can stop us.",13.0,2.0
Ty Lee," Hmmm, what about those muscle-y guys down there?",13.0,2.0
Qin, Please. The drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack.,13.0,2.0

Sokka,Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?,13.0,2.0
Aang, That.,13.0,2.0
Ying, We made it to Ba Sing Se and we're still not safe. No one is! ,13.0,2.0
Earthbender guard,What are you people doing here? Civilians aren't allowed on the wall!,13.0,2.0

General Sung," It is an honor to welcome you to the Outer Wall, young Avatar, but your help is not needed.",13.0,2.0
Aang,Not needed?,13.0,2.0
General Sung,"  Not  needed. I have the situation under control. I assure you the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall. Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded.",13.0,2.0
Toph,What about the Dragon of the West? He got in.,13.0,2.0
General Sung," Well ... uh, technically yes, but he was quickly expunged.  Nevertheless, that is why the city is named Ba Sing Se. It's the ""impenetrable city"". They don't call it Na Sing Se.  That means ""penetrable city.""",13.0,2.0
Toph,"Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem.",13.0,2.0
General Sung,"Not for long. To stop it, I've sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Terra Team.",13.0,2.0
Sokka,That's a good group name. Very catchy.,13.0,2.0
Terra Team leader,Ready ... attack!,13.0,2.0
General Sung, We're doomed! ,13.0,2.0
Sokka," Get a hold of yourself, man!",13.0,2.0

General Sung," Yes, please.",13.0,2.0
Aang,"The question is, how are we going to stop that thing? ",13.0,2.0
Sokka,Why are you all looking at me?,13.0,2.0
Aang,You're the idea guy.,13.0,2.0
Sokka, So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure.,13.0,2.0
Katara,And also the complaining guy.,13.0,2.0
Sokka,That part I don't mind.,13.0,2.0
Ticket woman,"So, Mr. Lee and Mr. ummm ... Mushy, is it?",13.0,2.0
Iroh,It's pronounced Mushi.,13.0,2.0
Ticket woman, You telling me how to do my job?,13.0,2.0

Jet,I can respect that.,13.0,2.0
General Sung,What's wrong with him? He doesn't look injured.,13.0,2.0
Katara,His chi is blocked.  Who did this to you?,13.0,2.0
Terra Team member,Two girls ambushed us. One of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs and suddenly I couldn't earthbend anymore and I could barely move. Then she cartwheeled away.,13.0,2.0

Sokka," Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Ooh!",13.0,2.0
Katara,Yes?,13.0,2.0
Sokka,What you just said! That's how we're going to take down the drill! The same way Ty Lee took down all those big earthbenders!,13.0,2.0

Sokka,There!,13.0,2.0
Sokka,"Toph, come on!",13.0,2.0
Toph,No way am I going in that metal monster. I can't bend in there. I'll try to slow it down out here.,13.0,2.0
Sokka,"Okay, good luck! ",13.0,2.0
Sokka,I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find its weak points.,13.0,2.0
Aang,Where are we going to get something like that?  What are you doing? Someone's going to hear us!,13.0,2.0
Sokka,That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it. And when something breaks ...,13.0,2.0
Katara,They come to fix it!,13.0,2.0
Katara, Hi.,13.0,2.0
Sokka,This'll work. Thanks!,13.0,2.0
Sokka,"It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures. There's the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell. The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse.",13.0,2.0
Jet,"So, you guys got plans once you're inside the city?",13.0,2.0
Tea seller,Get your hot tea here! Finest tea in Ba Sing Se!,13.0,2.0

Jet,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?",13.0,2.0
Jet,You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together. You want to join the Freedom Fighters?,13.0,2.0
Zuko,"Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.",13.0,2.0
Jet,"Come on, we made a great team looting that captain's food. Think of all the good we could do for these refugees.",13.0,2.0
Zuko, I said no.,13.0,2.0
Jet,Have it your way.,13.0,2.0
Iroh,Hey!,13.0,2.0
Zuko," What are you doing firebending your tea? For a wise, old man, that was a pretty stupid move!",13.0,2.0
Iroh," I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ...  it's just so sad!",13.0,2.0
Sokka,"Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.",13.0,2.0
Katara," What's this ""we"" stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.",13.0,2.0
Sokka," Look, I'm the plan guy. You two  are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys.  Together, we're Team Avatar!",13.0,2.0

Sokka, C'mon brace ... budge! ,13.0,2.0
Katara,"This is bad,  really  bad.",13.0,2.0
Sokka,"We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!",13.0,2.0
Aang," Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike.  Sokka, take a fighting stance. You've got to be quick and accurate. Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance.  And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow.  His own weight becomes his downfall, literally.",13.0,2.0
Katara,"So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through.",13.0,2.0
Aang,Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow.,13.0,2.0
Sokka, And boom! It all comes crashing down!,13.0,2.0

Azula,Follow them! The Avatar's mine!,13.0,2.0
Katara, Slurry pipeline? What does that mean?,13.0,2.0

Joo Dee, You're in Ba Sing Se now. Everyone is safe here.,14.0,2.0
Joo Dee,This is the Lower Ring.,14.0,2.0
Katara,What's that wall for?,14.0,2.0
Joo Dee,"Oh, Ba Sing Se has many walls! There are the ones outside protecting us, and the ones inside, that help maintain order.  This is where our newest arrivals live, as well as our craftsman and artisans, people that work with their hands.  It's so quaint and lively!",14.0,2.0

Pet store owner, Uh ...  That would be illegal. You'll have to leave now; your lemur is harassing my sparrowkeets.,14.0,2.0
University student,"Hmm ... I've never seen any sandbenders or nomads around here.  You should ask Professor Zei, he teaches the class on desert cultures.",14.0,2.0

Jet,"Well, maybe if you'd help me!",14.0,2.0
Smellerbee," Jet, you gotta stop this.",14.0,2.0

Long Feng," Good. Now go await further orders.  If the Avatar keeps searching for his bison, it could upset the delicate balance we've worked so hard to achieve in this city. It could even cost us control of the Earth King.",17.0,2.0
Dai Li agent,Should we take care of him?,17.0,2.0
Long Feng,No. It's much too dangerous for us to confront him directly. Let's see if we can still handle this quietly.,17.0,2.0
Iroh,"So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.",17.0,2.0
Zuko, The Avatar is here in Ba Sing Se and he's lost his bison.,17.0,2.0
Iroh," We have a chance for a new life here.  If you start stirring up trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us.",17.0,2.0
Zuko, Good things that are happening for  you  ! Have you ever thought that I want more from life than a nice apartment and a job serving tea?,17.0,2.0
Iroh,There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want from your life and why.,17.0,2.0
Zuko,I want my destiny.,17.0,2.0
Iroh,"What that means is up to you.  The Tea Weevil! No, that's stupid.",17.0,2.0
Sokka,"We'll split up to cover more area. Toph, I guess you should just come with me.",17.0,2.0
Toph," Why? Because you think I can't put up posters on my own?!  It's upside-down, isn't it? I'll just go with Sokka.",17.0,2.0
Jet,Katara?,17.0,2.0
Jet," I think I can help you.  Katara, I've changed!",17.0,2.0
Katara," Tell it to some other girl, Jet! ",17.0,2.0
Jet," I don't want to fight you, I'm here to help!",17.0,2.0
Sokka,"Katara, what is it?",17.0,2.0
Katara,Jet's back.  We can't trust anything Jet says.,17.0,2.0
Sokka,But we don't even know why he's here!,17.0,2.0
Katara,"I don't care why he's here, whatever the reason is, it can't be good!",17.0,2.0
Jet,I'm here to help you find Appa! ,17.0,2.0
Aang," Katara, we have to give him a chance.",17.0,2.0
Jet,"I swear, I've changed! I was a troubled person and I let my anger get out of control, but I don't even have the gang now! I've put all that behind me!",17.0,2.0
Katara,You're lying!,17.0,2.0
Toph, He's not lying.,17.0,2.0
Sokka,How can you tell?,17.0,2.0
Toph,"I can feel his breathing and heartbeat. When people lie, there's a physical reaction. He's telling the truth.",17.0,2.0
Aang,"Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out.",17.0,2.0
Katara,All right.  But we're not letting you out of our sight.,17.0,2.0
Jet,This is the place I heard about.,17.0,2.0
Aang,There's nothing here.,17.0,2.0
Katara, If this is a trap–,17.0,2.0
Jet,"I told you, I work nearby! Two guys were talking about some giant furry creature they had, I figured it must be Appa!",17.0,2.0
Toph,He was here! ,17.0,2.0
Aang, We missed him. ,17.0,2.0
Old Sweepy,"They took that big thing yesterday.  Shipped him out to some island. About time, I've been cleaning up fur, and various, uhhh ... leavings all day.",17.0,2.0
Aang, What island? Where's Appa?,17.0,2.0
Old Sweepy,"Foreman said some rich royal type on Whaletail Island bought him up. Guess for a zoo or such. Though, could be the meat that'd be good.",17.0,2.0
Aang,We've got to get to Whaletail Island!  Where's Whaletail Island? ,17.0,2.0
Sokka," Far, very far.  Here it is. It's near the South Pole, almost all the way back home.",17.0,2.0
Katara,"Aang, it will take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom. And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island.",17.0,2.0
Aang,I don't care. We have a chance to find Appa! We have to try!,17.0,2.0
Old Sweepy,Must be nice to visit an island. I haven't had a vacation for years.,17.0,2.0
Katara,Don't you have some more hair to clean up?,17.0,2.0
Old Sweepy,"Shuffle on, I get you. No more need for Old Sweepy ...",17.0,2.0
Katara,"You're right Aang, right now our first concern has to be finding Appa. We can come back when we have him.",17.0,2.0
Sokka,"All right, let's get moving.",17.0,2.0
Jet,I'll come with you.,17.0,2.0
Katara,We don't need your help!,17.0,2.0
Jet,Why won't you trust me? ,17.0,2.0
Katara,"Gee, I wonder.",17.0,2.0
Toph, Was this guy your boyfriend or something?,17.0,2.0
Katara,What ... no! ,17.0,2.0
Toph, I can tell you're lying ... ,17.0,2.0
Sokka,We can take the train out to the wall but then we'll have to walk.,17.0,2.0
Aang,"Don't worry, on the way back we'll be flying!",17.0,2.0
Toph,We're finally leaving Ba Sing Se.  Worst ... city ... ever!,17.0,2.0
Smellerbee, Jet!,17.0,2.0
Katara," I thought you said you didn't have your ""gang"" anymore!",17.0,2.0
Jet, I don't!,17.0,2.0
Smellerbee, We were so worried. How did you get away from the Dai Li? ,17.0,2.0
Katara, The Dai Li?!,17.0,2.0
Jet,I don't know what she's talking about!,17.0,2.0
Smellerbee,He got arrested by the Dai Li a couple of weeks ago. We saw them drag him away!,17.0,2.0
Jet,Why would I be arrested? I've been living peacefully in the city!,17.0,2.0
Toph, This doesn't make any sense. They're both telling the truth.,17.0,2.0
Katara,That's impossible.,17.0,2.0
Sokka,No it's not! Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed!,17.0,2.0
Jet,That's crazy! It can't be!  Stay away from me!,17.0,2.0
Zuko,"Out of my way, skinny!",17.0,2.0
Dai Li agent,Huh?,17.0,2.0
Zuko,"If you don't want to end up like him, you'll do what I say.",17.0,2.0
Katara,"The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot, too!",17.0,2.0
Aang,I bet they have Appa here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet! Where did they take you?,17.0,2.0
Jet,Nowhere! I- I don't know what you're talking about!,17.0,2.0
Aang,We need to find a way to jog his real memories.,17.0,2.0
Sokka, Maybe Katara should kiss him. That should bring something back!,17.0,2.0
Katara,"Maybe  you  should kiss him, Sokka!",17.0,2.0
Sokka,"Hey, just an idea!",17.0,2.0
Aang, A bad one.,17.0,2.0
Sokka,"Ooh, wait! I've got it!",17.0,2.0
Jet,I don't think it's working. ,17.0,2.0
Toph,Try to think of something from your past that triggers your emotions.,17.0,2.0
Smellerbee,The Fire Nation! Remember what they did to your family!,17.0,2.0
Katara,Close your eyes. Picture it.,17.0,2.0
Jet, No! It's too painful!,17.0,2.0
Katara,Maybe this will help. ,17.0,2.0
Jet,They took me to a headquarters under the water. Like a lake!,17.0,2.0
Sokka,Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said? She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai!,17.0,2.0
Jet, That's it! Lake Laogai.,17.0,2.0
Sokka,So where's this secret headquarters?,17.0,2.0
Jet,"Under the water, I think.",17.0,2.0
Toph,There's a tunnel right there by the shore.,17.0,2.0
Jet,It's all starting to come back to me!,17.0,2.0
Brainwasher,I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se.,17.0,2.0
Joo Dees, I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se.,17.0,2.0
Brainwasher,We're so lucky to have our walls to create order.,17.0,2.0
Joo Dees, We're so lucky to have our walls to create order.,17.0,2.0
Jet,I think there might be a cell big enough to hold Appa up ahead. I think it's through here! ,17.0,2.0
Zuko,Expecting someone else?,17.0,2.0
Sokka,Now that's something different.,17.0,2.0
Long Feng,You have made yourselves enemies of the state. Take them into custody.,17.0,2.0
Aang, Long Feng is escaping!,17.0,2.0
Long Feng,"All right, Avatar, you've caused me enough problems. This is your last chance ... if you want your bison back.",17.0,2.0
Aang,You do have Appa! Tell me where he is!,17.0,2.0
Long Feng,"Agree to exit the city now, and I'll waive all charges against you and allow you to leave with your lost pet.",17.0,2.0
Jet, You're in no position to bargain.,17.0,2.0
Long Feng,Am I not?,17.0,2.0
Aang, You're definitely not!,17.0,2.0
Long Feng,"Jet, the Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai.",17.0,2.0
Jet, I am honored to accept his invitation.,17.0,2.0
Zuko,You're mine now.,17.0,2.0
Zuko,Uncle?,17.0,2.0
Iroh,"So, the Blue Spirit. I wonder who could be behind that mask ...",17.0,2.0
Zuko, What are you doing here?,17.0,2.0
Iroh,I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep him locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?,17.0,2.0
Zuko,First I have to get it out of here.,17.0,2.0
Iroh," And then what!? You never think these things through!  This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had nowhere to go!",17.0,2.0
Zuko,I would have figured something out!,17.0,2.0
Iroh,"No! If his friends hadn't found you, you would have frozen to death!",17.0,2.0
Zuko,"I know my own destiny, Uncle!",17.0,2.0
Iroh,"Is it your own destiny, or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?",17.0,2.0
Zuko,"Stop it, Uncle! I have to do this!",17.0,2.0
Iroh,"I'm begging you, Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you, and what do  you  want?",17.0,2.0
Aang,"Jet, it's me, Aang!  You don't have to do this!",17.0,2.0
Long Feng,I'm afraid he no longer has a choice.,17.0,2.0
Aang,"Jet, I'm your friend! Look inside your heart!",17.0,2.0
Long Feng,"Do your duty, Jet!",17.0,2.0
Aang,He can't make you do this!  You're a Freedom Fighter!,17.0,2.0
Long Feng,Do it! Do it now!,17.0,2.0
Long Feng, Foolish boy. You've chosen your own demise. ,17.0,2.0
Jet, I'm sorry ... Aang.,17.0,2.0
Aang, Don't be.,17.0,2.0
Katara,This isn't good.,17.0,2.0
Smellerbee,You guys go and find Appa. We'll take care of Jet.,17.0,2.0
Katara,We're not going to leave you.,17.0,2.0
Longshot,There's no time. Just go. We'll take care of him. He's our leader.,17.0,2.0
Jet,"Don't worry, Katara. I'll be fine. ",17.0,2.0
Toph, He's lying ...,17.0,2.0
Aang,Appa's gone! Long Feng beat us here.,17.0,2.0
Sokka,"If we keep moving, maybe we can catch up with them!",17.0,2.0
Sokka,You think we can outrun them?,17.0,2.0
Aang,I don't think it's gonna matter!,17.0,2.0
Aang,"What is it, Momo?",17.0,2.0
Aang,Appa!,17.0,2.0
Long Feng,I can handle you by myself.,17.0,2.0
Sokka,Yeah! Appa!,17.0,2.0
Aang," I missed you, buddy.",17.0,2.0
Iroh,"You did the right thing, nephew.  Leave it behind.",17.0,2.0
Aang,"I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy. ",18.0,2.0
Sokka,"Look, we escaped from the Dai Li. We got Appa back. I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.",18.0,2.0
Katara,One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we'll need the Earth King's support.",18.0,2.0
Toph,"What makes you think we'll get it? I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang.",18.0,2.0
Sokka,"I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different.",18.0,2.0
Katara,"Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.",18.0,2.0
Toph,I'm with Sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se.  And I can't even see!,18.0,2.0
Aang,"But now that we have Appa back, there's nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth. About the conspiracy and the War.",18.0,2.0
Sokka,See? Aang's with me.  It's the whole reason we came here in the first place. We have to try.,18.0,2.0
Katara," Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change. ",18.0,2.0
Toph," I don't trust the new positive Sokka.  Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!?",18.0,2.0
Sokka,That's probably the Dai Li searching for us.  So?,18.0,2.0
Katara, Let's fly!,18.0,2.0
Toph,Can we please buy a new saddle? Riding bareback is terrifying! ,18.0,2.0
Sokka,There it is! That whole thing is the palace! The Earth King's chamber should be in the center!,18.0,2.0
Katara,We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in and-  Aahh!",18.0,2.0
Toph,What was that?,18.0,2.0
Sokka,Surface-to-air rocks!  More incoming!,18.0,2.0
Katara, Sorry!,18.0,2.0
Katara,Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King!,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side!  Sorry.",18.0,2.0
Sokka,In there! ,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"Toph, which way to the Earth King?",18.0,2.0
Toph,How should I know? I'm still voting we  leave  Ba Sing Se.,18.0,2.0
Palace woman,Burglar! ,18.0,2.0
Sokka, Sorry. Wrong door.,18.0,2.0
Iroh,You did the right thing. Letting the Avatar's bison go free.,18.0,2.0
Zuko,I don't feel right. ,18.0,2.0
Iroh,Zuko! ,18.0,2.0
Sokka,Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere.  Yaaah!  A little warning next time?,18.0,2.0
Aang,We need to talk to you.,18.0,2.0
Long Feng, They're here to overthrow you.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"No, we're on your side. We're here to help.",18.0,2.0
Katara,You have to trust us.,18.0,2.0
Kuei," You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door, and you expect me to trust you?",18.0,2.0
Toph,He has a good point.,18.0,2.0
Kuei,"If you are on my side, then drop your weapons and stand down!",18.0,2.0
Aang," See? We're friends, Your Earthiness. ",18.0,2.0
Long Feng, Detain the assailants!,18.0,2.0
Sokka,But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.,18.0,2.0
Long Feng,Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again. ,18.0,2.0
Kuei,The Avatar?  You're the Avatar?,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"Uh, no. Him. ",18.0,2.0
Aang, Over here. ,18.0,2.0
Long Feng,"What does it matter, Your Highness? They're enemies of the state.",18.0,2.0
Kuei,Perhaps you're right.  Though Bosco seems to like him.  I'll hear what he has to say. ,18.0,2.0
Aang," Well, sir, there's a war going on right now. For the past one hundred years in fact. The Dai Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.",18.0,2.0
Kuei,A secret war? That's crazy!,18.0,2.0
Long Feng,Completely!,18.0,2.0
Aang,"Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes; he brainwashed our friend!",18.0,2.0
Long Feng," All lies. I've never even seen a sky bison, Your Majesty. Frankly, I thought they were extinct.",18.0,2.0
Kuei, Your claim is difficult to believe. Even from an Avatar.,18.0,2.0
Long Feng," These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks.  If you listen to them, you're playing right into your own destruction.",18.0,2.0
Kuei, I have to trust my advisor.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,Wait!  I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison. Ask him to lift his robe.,18.0,2.0
Long Feng,What? I am  not  disrobing! ,18.0,2.0
Aang,Right there! Appa bit him!,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"Never met a sky bison, huh?",18.0,2.0
Long Feng, That happens to be a large birth mark.  Thanks for showing everyone.,18.0,2.0
Kuei,Well I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,Of course there is!,18.0,2.0
Kuei,"Yup. That pretty much proves it.  But it doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory.  Though, I suppose this matter's worth looking into. ",18.0,2.0
Iroh,You're burning up.  You have an intense fever.  This will help cool you down.,18.0,2.0
Zuko,So thirsty. ,18.0,2.0
Iroh, Here's some clean water to drink.  Stay under the blankets and sweat this out.,18.0,2.0
Kuei, So this is what a train is like? I didn't realize it would be this ... public.,18.0,2.0
Katara,So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before?,18.0,2.0
Kuei,"I've never been outside the palace.  Now that's the way to travel.  So, may I ask where we're going?",18.0,2.0
Sokka,"Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.",18.0,2.0
Toph,It's gone!,18.0,2.0
Sokka,Oh don't tell me- !  That's okay. Still got my positive attitude.,18.0,2.0
Katara,The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence!,18.0,2.0
Kuei, Hm ...  That seems awfully convenient.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more. ",18.0,2.0
Kuei,"Long Feng was right. This was a waste of time.  If you'll excuse me, I'm going back to the palace.",18.0,2.0
Katara, The wall. They'll never be able to cover that up in time.,18.0,2.0
Aang,"Oh, yeah.  If you come with us to the Outer Wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real.",18.0,2.0
Kuei,No Earth King has ever been to the Outer Wall.  I don't have any more time for this nonsense. ,18.0,2.0
Sokka," If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa. ",18.0,2.0
Toph,First time flying?,18.0,2.0
Kuei,It's both thrilling and terrifying!,18.0,2.0
Toph,"Yeah.  I hate it, too.",18.0,2.0
Kuei,I have to be honest with you: part of me really hopes that what you're telling me about this war isn't true.,18.0,2.0
Aang,I wish it wasn't.,18.0,2.0
Blue dragon," It's getting late. Are you planning to retire soon, my lord?",18.0,2.0
Zuko,I'm not tired.,18.0,2.0
Blue dragon," Relax, Fire Lord Zuko. Just let go. Give in to it. Shut your eyes for a while.",18.0,2.0
Red dragon," No, Fire Lord Zuko! Do not listen to the blue dragon. You should get out of here right now. Go! Before it's too late! ",18.0,2.0
Blue dragon,"Sleep now, Fire Lord Zuko.",18.0,2.0
Blue dragon,Sleep.  Just like  mother  !,18.0,2.0
Ursa,Zuko! Help me! ,18.0,2.0
Aang, It's still there!,18.0,2.0
Kuei, What is that?,18.0,2.0
Sokka,It's a drill. A giant drill  made by the Fire Nation to break through your walls. ,18.0,2.0
Kuei,I can't believe I never knew. ,18.0,2.0
Long Feng," I can explain this, Your Majesty.  This is nothing more than ... a construction project. ",18.0,2.0
Katara," Really? Then perhaps you could explain why there's a  Fire Nation insignia on your ""construction project"".",18.0,2.0
Long Feng, Well it's imported of course. You know you can't trust domestic machinery.  Surely you don't believe these children instead of your most loyal attendant?,18.0,2.0
Kuei, Dai Li! Arrest Long Feng! I want him to stand trial for crimes against the Earth Kingdom.,18.0,2.0
Long Feng,You can't arrest me! You all need me more than you know! ,18.0,2.0
Sokka," Looks like Long Feng is long gone! Ha! Ah, yeah, I've been waiting to use that one. ",18.0,2.0
Kuei,"I want to thank you, young heroes, for opening my eyes. All this time, what I thought was a great metropolis was merely a city of fools. And that makes me the king fool.  We're at war. With the Fire Nation.",18.0,2.0
Sokka,"That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness: because we think you can help us end the war.",18.0,2.0
Aang, We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity: A solar eclipse is coming. The sun will be completely blocked out by the moon, and the firebenders will be helpless.",18.0,2.0
Kuei,"What are you suggesting, Sokka?",18.0,2.0
Sokka,That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation.  The Day of Black Sun.,18.0,2.0
Kuei,I don't know. That would require moving troops out of Ba Sing Se. We'd be completely vulnerable.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,"You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance.",18.0,2.0
Kuei, Very well. You have my support.,18.0,2.0
General How,Your Majesty.  I apologize for the interruption.,18.0,2.0
Kuei," This is General How. He's the leader of the Council of Five, my highest ranking generals.",18.0,2.0
General How,We searched Long Feng's office. I think we found something that will interest everybody. ,18.0,2.0
General How,There are secret files on everyone in Ba Sing Se. Including you kids.,18.0,2.0
Aang,Secret files?,18.0,2.0
Kuei," ""Toph Beifong."" ",18.0,2.0
Katara, It's a letter from your mom. Your mom's here in the city. And she wants to see you. ,18.0,2.0
Toph,Long Feng intercepted our letters from home?  That's just sad.,18.0,2.0
Kuei, Aang?,18.0,2.0
General How,This scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the Dai Li captured it.,18.0,2.0
Aang, It's from the Eastern Air Temple.,18.0,2.0
Katara,Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?,18.0,2.0
Kuei, I'm afraid not.,18.0,2.0
Sokka, Oh.,18.0,2.0
General How,But there is an intelligence report that might interest you. ,18.0,2.0
Katara," ""A small fleet of Water Tribe ships.""",18.0,2.0
Sokka, What? That could be Dad!,18.0,2.0
Katara," ""Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay.  Led by Hakoda.""  It  is  Dad!",18.0,2.0
Iroh,"You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea. ",18.0,2.0
Zuko,What's happening?,18.0,2.0
Iroh,Your critical decision. What you did beneath that lake. It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body. ,18.0,2.0
Zuko,What's that mean? ,18.0,2.0
Iroh,"You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it,  you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be.",18.0,2.0
Aang,I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a guru.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,What's a guru? Some kind of poisonous blow fish?,18.0,2.0
Aang,"No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.",18.0,2.0
Katara,And I can't believe we know where our dad is now.,18.0,2.0
Toph,I know what you mean. My mom's in the city. And from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.,18.0,2.0
Sokka,This is all such big news! Where do we even start?,18.0,2.0
Katara,"I hate to say it, but we have to split up.",18.0,2.0
Aang, Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together! Now you want us to separate?,18.0,2.0
Katara,"You have to meet this guru, Aang. If we're going to invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.",18.0,2.0
Aang,"Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple, Appa and I can drop you off at Chameleon Bay to see your dad.",18.0,2.0
Sokka,Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion.  I guess that's me.,18.0,2.0
Katara,"No, Sokka. I know how badly you wanna help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay. I'll stay here with the king.",18.0,2.0
Sokka, You are the nicest ... sister ... ever! ,18.0,2.0
Katara,"Easy there, big brother ...  Though you're right. I am.",18.0,2.0
Aang,Katara? I need to tell you something.  I've been wanting to say it for a long time.,18.0,2.0
Katara,"What is it, Aang?",18.0,2.0
Aang," Katara, I- ",18.0,2.0
Sokka, All right. Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip? ,18.0,2.0
Kuei,"Aang and Sokka,  I wish you a good journey. Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks. We look forward to your safe return. ",18.0,2.0

Sokka, That's Suki! ,18.0,2.0
Kuei,You know these warriors?,18.0,2.0

Sokka," Aahh! Great. That's enough.  Okay, we love each other.  Seriously.",18.0,2.0

Aang," Yeah. Girls are waiting for us. Thanks, positive attitude.",18.0,2.0
Sokka,Everything is gonna work out perfectly. From now on and forever. ,18.0,2.0
Agent," Dinner.  The Council of Five and the military are loyal to the Earth King,  but the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir. ",18.0,2.0
Toph, Hello? Mom? Anyone home?  Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with!?,18.0,2.0
Xin Fu,One loud-mouthed little brat who strayed too far from home.,18.0,2.0
Kuei,"In our hour of need, it is with the highest honor that I welcome our esteemed allies, the Kyoshi Warriors!",18.0,2.0
Azula,We are the Earth King's humble servants.,18.0,2.0
Zuko,What's that smell?,19.0,2.0
Iroh,It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.,19.0,2.0
Zuko," Actually, it smells delicious. I'd love a bowl, Uncle. ",19.0,2.0
Iroh,"Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow.",19.0,2.0
Zuko," It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop.  Things are looking up, Uncle. ",19.0,2.0
Aang,You haven't seen your dad in over two years. You must be so excited!,19.0,2.0
Sokka," I know I should be, but, I just feel sick to my stomach. ",19.0,2.0
Aang,Don't be nervous. He's going to be so happy to see you! ,19.0,2.0
Sokka,So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this guru?,19.0,2.0
Aang,Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. I'll do whatever it takes.  See you in a week. Yip yip!,19.0,2.0
Water Tribe warrior,"Sokka, good to see you.",19.0,2.0
Hakoda,Sokka.,19.0,2.0
Sokka,"Hi, Dad.",19.0,2.0
Kuei,"Look Bosco! The Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us! Aren't you excited?  It's been a difficult week for me. My most trusted advisor, Long Feng, and his Dai Li agents tried to take control of Ba Sing Se from me.",19.0,2.0
Azula,It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.,19.0,2.0
Kuei," But there is good news. As we speak, the Council of Five is meeting to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation this summer, on the day of a solar eclipse.",19.0,2.0
Azula,Really? Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan. ,19.0,2.0
General How,"General Fong's base will serve as the launching point for the attack. In exactly two months, the army and navy will invade the Fire Nation on the Day of Black Sun.",19.0,2.0
Katara,"Or we could send in Momo to do some damage!  'Cause, the ... sorry.",19.0,2.0
General How, All we need is the Earth King's seal in order to execute the plan. ,19.0,2.0
Katara,"I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How.",19.0,2.0
Aang,"Uhhh ... hello? You're Guru Pathik, right?  The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?",19.0,2.0
Pathik,Indeed. I was a spiritual brother of your people and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso. ,19.0,2.0
Aang,"In your note,  you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State. How?",19.0,2.0
Pathik,"You must gain balance within yourself, before you can bring balance to the world. And the first step to gaining balance begins with this.  Drink up!",19.0,2.0
Aang, Uggh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!,19.0,2.0
Pathik,That's because it is!  Yum yum!,19.0,2.0
Yu,I believe we need to go right!,19.0,2.0
Xin Fu,What are you talking about? The Beifong Estate's this way!,19.0,2.0
Yu,I'm quite certain you're mistaken.,19.0,2.0
Toph, Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second?  I got to go to the bathroom!,19.0,2.0
Yu,"Oooh ... uhhh, okay, but make it quick! ",19.0,2.0
Xin Fu, What's wrong with you?,19.0,2.0
Yu,"Ooh, very sneaky Toph! Nice try, but you can't trick me! ",19.0,2.0
Toph,Let me out of here so I can kick both your butts!,19.0,2.0
Xin Fu,"Quit your banging!  You might think you're the greatest earthbender in the world, but even you can't bend metal!",19.0,2.0
Azula,"We have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity, girls.",19.0,2.0
Ty Lee,Mai finally gets to wear make-up that's not totally depressing? ,19.0,2.0
Mai," Ha, ha.",19.0,2.0
Azula,"I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom.  For one hundred years, the Fire Nation has hammered away at Ba Sing Se from the outside.  But now we're on the inside, and we can take it by ourselves.",19.0,2.0
Ty Lee," Gosh, you're so confident. I really admire that about you.",19.0,2.0
Azula,"From the inside, we're in perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King. The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li  controls Ba Sing Se.",19.0,2.0
Pathik,"In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras.",19.0,2.0
Aang, What are chakras?,19.0,2.0
Pathik," Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basics.  The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras.",19.0,2.0
Aang,So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"Exactly. If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek. And then what happens?",19.0,2.0
Aang,The creek can't flow?,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"Yes. But, if we open the ponds between the pools ... ",19.0,2.0
Aang,The energy flows! ,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck. Be warned, opening the chakras is an intense experience, and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open. Are you ready?",19.0,2.0
Aang, I'll do whatever it takes.,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and is blocked by fear. What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you.",19.0,2.0
Pathik,"Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival, but you must surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek.  You have opened your Earth Chakra! ",19.0,2.0
Pathik,Next is the ...,19.0,2.0
Aang,Water Chakra?,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a guru too! This chakra deals with pleasure and is blocked by guilt. Now, look at all the guilt with burdens you so. What do you blame yourself for?",19.0,2.0
Aang, I ran away.  I hurt all of those people.,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself. ",19.0,2.0
Hakoda,This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. We've been using these tangle mines to stop the Fire Nation ships from getting through.,19.0,2.0
Bato, Your father invented tangle mines himself.,19.0,2.0
Sokka,"Destructive? Buoyant? And ...  Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling!",19.0,2.0
Hakoda,"Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed. When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship. I call it the ""stink and sink.""",19.0,2.0
Sokka," Good one, Dad!",19.0,2.0
Bato, You're definitely your father's son.,19.0,2.0
Warrior," Hakoda, our scouts have spotted four Fire Nation ships!",19.0,2.0
Hakoda,"Bato, get these mines loaded up! The rest of you men, prepare for battle!",19.0,2.0
Sokka,"Uhhh ... what should I do, Dad?",19.0,2.0
Hakoda,"Aren't you listening? I said, ""The rest of you men, get ready for battle"".",19.0,2.0
Iroh,"Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop? Follow your passion, Zuko, and life will reward you.",19.0,2.0
Zuko,"Congratulations, Uncle.",19.0,2.0
Iroh,I am very thankful.,19.0,2.0
Zuko,You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.,19.0,2.0
Iroh,No. I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me. It means more than you know. ,19.0,2.0
Zuko,Now let's make these people some tea! ,19.0,2.0
Iroh," Yes, let's make some tea!",19.0,2.0
Pathik,"Third is the Fire Chakra, located in the stomach.",19.0,2.0
Aang, My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.,19.0,2.0
Pathik," Good one! Moving on. This chakra deals with willpower, and is blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of?  What are your biggest disappointments in yourself?",19.0,2.0
Aang,I'm never going to firebend again. I can't.,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar and therefore, you are a firebender.  Hmmm ... that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a ... burping bison.",19.0,2.0
Aang," Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles? ",19.0,2.0
Mai, I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone could fight in this.,19.0,2.0
Ty Lee,Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes. ,19.0,2.0
Mai,"How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King? If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm going to throw up.",19.0,2.0
Ty Lee, Princess Azula promised we would go back to the Fire Nation as soon as we captured the Avatar. We just have to be patient.,19.0,2.0
Mai, Shush up! Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation?,19.0,2.0
Ty Lee,Sorry!,19.0,2.0
Azula,"Good work, girls. I'm sure the Dai Li will deliver the message.",19.0,2.0
Pathik,The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love and is blocked by grief.  Lay all your grief out in front of you.,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"You have indeed felt a great loss.  But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us.  The Air Nomads' love for you has not left this world. It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love.",19.0,2.0
Pathik,Let the pain flow away.  Very good.,19.0,2.0
Aang," Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?",19.0,2.0
Pathik,"The fifth in the chain is the Sound Chakra, located in the throat. It deals with truth and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves.",19.0,2.0
Katara (flashback),Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?,19.0,2.0
Aang,Because I never wanted to be.,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"You cannot lie about your own nature. You must accept that you are the Avatar.  Very good, Aang. You have opened the chakra of truth.",19.0,2.0
Pathik,"The sixth pool of energy is the light chakra, located in the center of the forehead. It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation. Things you think are separate and different are actually one in the same.",19.0,2.0
Aang, Like the four nations.,19.0,2.0
Pathik," Yes. We are all one people,  but we live as if divided.",19.0,2.0
Aang,We're all connected. Everything is connected.,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"That's right! Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion. If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined.",19.0,2.0
Toph," Come on, metal. Budge!  Wooo! Toph, you rule.",19.0,2.0
Katara,"What do you say, Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king?  Table for two, please.",19.0,2.0
Zuko,"Uncle! I need two jasmine, one green, and one lychee!",19.0,2.0
Iroh,I'm brewing as fast as I can!,19.0,2.0
Aang,"This is the last chakra, isn't it?",19.0,2.0
Pathik,"Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able to go in and out of the Avatar State at will and when you are in the Avatar State, you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions.",19.0,2.0
Aang, Let's do this.,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"The Thought Chakra is located at the crown of the head. It deals with pure cosmic energy, and is blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world.  Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river, forgotten.",19.0,2.0
Aang, What? Why would I let go of Katara? I ... I love her!,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe.",19.0,2.0
Aang,Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara?  How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago that was a good thing!,19.0,2.0
Pathik,You must learn to let go. ,19.0,2.0
Katara,"Thank goodness you're here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city, I just saw Prince Zuko and his uncle!  We have to tell the Earth King right away!",19.0,2.0
Azula,"Oh, don't worry, I'll be sure to let him know.",19.0,2.0
Azula," So, Zuzu's in the city, too? I think it's time for a family reunion. ",19.0,2.0
Aang,"I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.",19.0,2.0
Pathik,"Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Surrender yourself.",19.0,2.0
Aang,"Okay, I'll try.",19.0,2.0
Pathik,Now think of your attachments and let them go. Let the pure cosmic energy flow.,19.0,2.0
Aang,Katara's in danger! I have to go! ,19.0,2.0
Pathik,"No, Aang! By choosing attachment, you have locked the chakra! If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!",19.0,2.0
Yu,It's another one her tricks!,19.0,2.0
Xin Fu,There's a giant hole in the box! How is that a trick!?,19.0,2.0
Toph, It's not! It's the real deal!,19.0,2.0
Toph, I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it! ,19.0,2.0
Xin Fu," I'm going to be stuck in here forever with you, aren't I?",19.0,2.0
Yu,I have to go the bathroom. ,19.0,2.0
Hakoda,Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?,19.0,2.0
Sokka,"You don't know how much this means to me, Dad. I'll make you proud and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am.",19.0,2.0
Hakoda," Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me. I'm already proud of you and I've always known you're a great warrior.",19.0,2.0
Sokka,Really?,19.0,2.0
Hakoda,Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left?,19.0,2.0
Sokka,This can't be good news.,19.0,2.0
Azula,What is this about? Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here? You will not treat a Kyoshi Warrior this way!,19.0,2.0
Long Feng,"But you're not a Kyoshi Warrior, are you,  Princess Azula of the Fire Nation?",19.0,2.0
Azula,What do you want?,19.0,2.0
Long Feng,I want to make a deal. It's time that I regain control of Ba Sing Se and you have something I need.,19.0,2.0
Azula,Oh?,19.0,2.0
Long Feng,The Earth King's trust.,19.0,2.0
Azula,Why should I help you?,19.0,2.0
Long Feng,Because I can get you the Avatar.,19.0,2.0
Azula, I'm listening ...,19.0,2.0
Royal messenger,A message from the Royal Palace.,19.0,2.0
Iroh, I ... I can't believe it!,19.0,2.0
Zuko,"What is it, Uncle?",19.0,2.0
Iroh, Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King! ,19.0,2.0
Sokka,"So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?",20.0,2.0
Aang,"I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help.",20.0,2.0
Sokka,It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time.  What is that?,20.0,2.0
Sokka,Need a ride?,20.0,2.0
Azula," The Earth King and the Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.  This coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government.  If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all,  I will snuff it out.  That is all.",20.0,2.0
Ty Lee,"Nice speech, Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way. ",20.0,2.0
Mai, Yeah. I thought you were going to make that one guy pee his pants.,20.0,2.0
Azula,"There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and uncle.",20.0,2.0
Iroh,"Many times I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace.  But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror. Instead, we are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.",20.0,2.0
Zuko,"It sure is, Uncle.",20.0,2.0
Toph,So how did it go with the guru? Did you master the Avatar State?,20.0,2.0
Aang,Uh ...,20.0,2.0
Pathik,"If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!",20.0,2.0
Sokka,"Aang, are you okay?",20.0,2.0
Aang,I'm great! It went great with the guru. I completely mastered the Avatar State.  Yeah.,20.0,2.0
Zuko,What's taking so long?,20.0,2.0
Iroh,Maybe the Earth King overslept.,20.0,2.0
Zuko,Something's not right.,20.0,2.0
Azula,It's tea time!,20.0,2.0
Zuko, Azula!,20.0,2.0
Azula,"Have you met the Dai Li? They're earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct that's  so  firebender. I just love it.",20.0,2.0
Iroh,"Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname ""The Dragon of the West""?",20.0,2.0
Azula,"I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, Uncle. ",20.0,2.0
Iroh,"It's more of a demonstration, really.",20.0,2.0
Iroh,Come on! You'll be fine!,20.0,2.0
Zuko,No! I'm tired of running! It's time I faced Azula!,20.0,2.0
Azula,You're  so  dramatic. What? Are you going to challenge me to an Agni Kai?,20.0,2.0
Zuko,Yes! I challenge you!,20.0,2.0
Azula,No thanks.,20.0,2.0
Kuei,Katara's fine. You have nothing to worry about.,20.0,2.0
Aang,"But, in my vision, I felt so sure she was in trouble.",20.0,2.0
Kuei,"Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion, and since then, she been off with your friends, the Kyoshi Warriors.",20.0,2.0
Sokka,"See, Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now talking about make-up or something.",20.0,2.0
Aang,Okay. Maybe you're right.,20.0,2.0
Kuei,"Believe me, if there was any danger at all, Bosco's animal instincts would sense it.",20.0,2.0

Iroh,I know how you must feel about my nephew.  But believe me when I tell you that there is  good  inside him.,20.0,2.0
Sokka," ""Good inside him"" isn't enough! Why don't you come back when it's  outside  him too, okay?",20.0,2.0
Aang,Katara's in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance.,20.0,2.0

Captured agent,Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup! They're going to overthrow the Earth King!,20.0,2.0
Sokka,My sister! Where are they keeping Katara?,20.0,2.0
Captured agent,"In the Crystal Catacombs of Old Ba Sing Se, deep beneath the palace.",20.0,2.0
Head of the Dai Li,The movements of the Earth King and all the generals have been plotted out step-by-step.,20.0,2.0
Long Feng,Good. And the Fire Nation princess is cooperating?,20.0,2.0
Head of the Dai Li,"Oh, yes. More than cooperating. She's really taken charge. She's terrifying and inspirational at the same time. It's hard to explain.",20.0,2.0
Katara,"Why did they throw you in here?  Oh, wait, let me guess. It's a trap. So that when Aang shows up to help me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches!",20.0,2.0
Katara, You're a terrible person! You know that? Always following us! Hunting the Avatar! Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood!,20.0,2.0
Zuko, You don't know what you're talking about!,20.0,2.0
Katara, I don't? How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through!  Me personally!  The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.,20.0,2.0
Zuko, I'm sorry.  That's something we have in common.,20.0,2.0
Toph,"Well, what'd you know? There  is  an ancient city down there. But it's deep.",20.0,2.0
Sokka,"We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk,  no offense.",20.0,2.0
Iroh, None taken.,20.0,2.0
Sokka,And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King of Azula's coup.,20.0,2.0
Aang,"So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea!",20.0,2.0
Iroh,The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?,20.0,2.0
Aang,"Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this  great  power, but to do it, I had to let go of someone I love.  And I just couldn't.",20.0,2.0
Iroh,Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.,20.0,2.0
Aang," What happens if we can't save anyone and beat Azula? Without the Avatar State, what if I'm not powerful enough?",20.0,2.0
Iroh,"I don't know the answer. Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving,  you will come to a better place.",20.0,2.0

Azula, This fight is over.,20.0,2.0
Azula,Get them all out of my sight.,20.0,2.0
Long Feng,"Now comes the part where I double cross you. Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation princess!  I said arrest her!  What is wrong with you?!",20.0,2.0
Azula,It's because they haven't made up their minds.  They're waiting to see how this is going to end.,20.0,2.0
Long Feng,What are you talking about?,20.0,2.0
Azula,"I can see your whole history in your eyes. You were born with nothing, so you've had to struggle, and connive, and claw your way to power. But true power, the divine right to rule, is something you're born with. The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne, and which one is going to be bowing down.  But I know, and you know.  Well?",20.0,2.0
Long Feng, You've beaten me at my own game.,20.0,2.0
Azula,Don't flatter yourself! You were never even a player.,20.0,2.0
Katara, I'm sorry I yelled at you before.,20.0,2.0

Katara,"It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.",20.0,2.0
Zuko,My face? I see. ,20.0,2.0
Katara,"No, no, that's-that's not what I mean. ",20.0,2.0
Zuko,"It's okay. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.",20.0,2.0
Katara,Maybe you could be free of it.,20.0,2.0
Zuko,What?,20.0,2.0
Katara,I have healing abilities.,20.0,2.0
Zuko,"It's a scar, it can't be healed.",20.0,2.0

Zuko," Why, Uncle?",20.0,2.0
Iroh,"You're not the man you used to be, Zuko.  You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny.  It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good.",20.0,2.0
Azula,"I expected this kind of treachery from Uncle.  But Zuko,  Prince  Zuko, you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?",20.0,2.0
Zuko,Release him immediately.,20.0,2.0
Azula,"It's not too late for you, Zuko. You can still redeem yourself.",20.0,2.0
Iroh, The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.,20.0,2.0
Azula,"Why don't you let  him  decide, Uncle?  I need you, Zuko. I've plotted every move of this day,  this glorious day in Fire Nation history, and the only way we win is together. At the end of this day, you will have your honor back. You will have Father's love. You will have everything you want.",20.0,2.0
Iroh,"Zuko, I am begging you.  Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want. ",20.0,2.0
Azula,You are free to choose.,20.0,2.0
Katara,We've got to find Sokka and Toph.,20.0,2.0
Toph,See any Dai Li agents nearby?,20.0,2.0

Mai," I just asked if you were cold, I didn't ask for your whole life story.  Stop worrying.",1.0,3.0

Sokka,"After what happened at Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety. We flew back to Chameleon Bay where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men.  The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone.  Well, not completely alone.  Soon, the bay was overrun by Fire Nation ships. Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise. Since then we've been traveling west. We crossed through the Serpent's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us.",1.0,3.0
Aang,So what now?,1.0,3.0
Hakoda,We've been working on a modified version of the invasion plan.,1.0,3.0
Katara, It's  Sokka's  invasion plan.,1.0,3.0
Hakoda,"Yes, Sokka's plan. We won't be able to mount a massive invasion without the Earth King's armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave the Fire Nation vulnerable.",1.0,3.0
Sokka,So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.,1.0,3.0

Aang,The world thinks I'm dead? How is that good news? That's terrible!,1.0,3.0
Sokka," No, it's great! It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore! And even better, they won't be expecting you on the Day of Black Sun!",1.0,3.0
Aang,"No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. This is so messed up!",1.0,3.0
Aang,I'll handle this. The Avatar is back. ,1.0,3.0
Katara," Aang, wait! Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation!",1.0,3.0
Hakoda,Everyone just stay calm.  Bato and I will take care of this.,1.0,3.0

Guard,Sir ... Admiral Chan has been on leave for two months at Ember Island.,1.0,3.0
Fire Navy officer,What? Why doesn't anyone ever tell me anything? Something's not right; they should have known that. I think this is a captured ship.  Just stay quiet until we're safely across the ramp. Then we'll sink this ship.,1.0,3.0
Toph,They know!,1.0,3.0

Zuko,"So, I didn't capture the Avatar.",1.0,3.0
Azula,Who cares? The Avatar is dead ...  unless you think he somehow miraculously survived.,1.0,3.0
Katara, This is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole. It has special properties so I've been saving it for something important.,1.0,3.0
Zuko,No. There's no way he could have survived. ,1.0,3.0

Sokka,"Aang, come on. Be practical.",1.0,3.0
Katara, You guys go ahead without us. We'll catch up to you.  I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much. You don't want people to think you failed.,1.0,3.0
Aang,"You're right, I don't. But the problem is, I did fail!",1.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, that's not true.",1.0,3.0
Aang, It  is  true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there! But I lost. And now the Earth Kingdom is fallen for good.,1.0,3.0
Katara,"It's not for good.  Remember, there's still a plan. The invasion!",1.0,3.0
Aang,"And I hate the invasion plan, too!  I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes! I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord. But now I know I need to do it alone.",1.0,3.0

Katara,He left.,1.0,3.0
Hakoda,What?,1.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone, that it's all his responsibility.",1.0,3.0
Hakoda,Maybe that's his way of being brave.,1.0,3.0
Katara,"It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid! We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much we need him, too? How can he just leave us behind?",1.0,3.0
Hakoda,"You're talking about me too, aren't you?",1.0,3.0
Katara,"How could you leave us, Dad?  I mean, I know we had Gran-Gran, and she loved us, but we were just so lost without you.",1.0,3.0
Hakoda,"I'm so sorry, Katara. ",1.0,3.0

Zuko, What did you hear?,1.0,3.0
Ozai,Azula told me everything. She said she was amazed and impressed at your power and ferocity at the moment of truth.,1.0,3.0
Aang,A blockade.,1.0,3.0
Zuko,Why'd you do it?,1.0,3.0
Azula, You're going to have to be a little more specific.,1.0,3.0
Zuko,Why did you tell Father that I was the one who killed the Avatar?,1.0,3.0
Azula,Can't this wait until the morning?,1.0,3.0
Zuko,It. Can't.,1.0,3.0
Azula," Fine. You seemed so worried about how Father would treat you because you hadn't captured the Avatar. I figured if I gave you the credit, you'd have nothing to worry about.",1.0,3.0
Zuko,But why?,1.0,3.0
Azula, Call it a generous gesture. I wanted to thank you for your help and I was happy to share the glory.,1.0,3.0

Azula, If you say so ...,1.0,3.0
Zuko,"You have another motive for doing this, I just haven't figured out what it is.",1.0,3.0
Azula,"Please Zuko, what ulterior motive could I have? What could I possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the Avatar?  Unless, somehow, the Avatar was actually alive. All that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness. But you said it yourself, that was impossible.  Sleep well, Zuzu.",1.0,3.0
Aang,I'm not gonna make it. I failed.  Roku?,1.0,3.0
Roku,"You haven't failed, Aang.",1.0,3.0

Roku,"If anyone is to blame for the state of the world, it is me. I should have seen this war coming and prevented it. You inherited my problems and my mistakes. But I believe you are destined to redeem me and save the world.",1.0,3.0
Aang,I don't know.,1.0,3.0
Yue,"You already saved the world. And you'll save the world again, but you can't give up.",1.0,3.0
Aang, You're right. I won't give up.,1.0,3.0
Katara,You're okay!,1.0,3.0
Aang,I have so much to do.,1.0,3.0
Katara,"I know, but you'll have our help.",1.0,3.0
Toph,"You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the Fire Nation, did you?",1.0,3.0
Aang,What about the invasion?,1.0,3.0
Sokka,We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse.,1.0,3.0
Toph," Hey! What's ... oh, it's your glider.",1.0,3.0
Aang,"It's okay. If someone saw it, it would give away my identity. It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive.",1.0,3.0
Guard,Who's there?!,2.0,3.0
Aang, I think I see a cave below.,2.0,3.0
Sokka, Sh! Keep quiet!,2.0,3.0
Sokka,"Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut. ",2.0,3.0
Toph," Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in.",2.0,3.0
Sokka," Hey, we're in enemy territory.  Those are enemy birds.",2.0,3.0
Sokka,"Well, this is it.  This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins.  Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ...",2.0,3.0
Katara," Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes.",2.0,3.0
Aang,"Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out.  If we get Fire Nation disguises,  we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.",2.0,3.0
Toph," Plus, they have real food out there. Does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers?",2.0,3.0
Sokka,"Looks like we got outvoted, sport. Let's get some new clothes.",2.0,3.0
Aang, I don't know about this.  These clothes belong to somebody.,2.0,3.0
Katara,I call the silk robe! ,2.0,3.0
Aang,But if it's essential to our survival ... then I call the suit! ,2.0,3.0

Aang, Uh ... your mom's necklace.,2.0,3.0

Aang," Who, me?",2.0,3.0
Male soldier,"It couldn't be more obvious that you don't belong here.  Next time you play hooky, you might wanna take off your school uniform.",2.0,3.0
Kwan,Oh. Is this a new mind ready for molding?,2.0,3.0
Aang,That's right.  Let the molding begin. ,2.0,3.0
Kwan,Wait a minute.  You're not from the Fire Nation.  Clearly you're from the colonies.,2.0,3.0
Aang,"Yeah, the colonies, of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom. ",2.0,3.0
Kwan,"Your etiquette is terrible. In the homeland, we bow to our elders.  Like so. ",2.0,3.0
Aang,"Sorry, ma'am.",2.0,3.0
Kwan,And we don't wear head coverings indoors.,2.0,3.0
Aang,Um ... I have a scar. It's really embarrassing.,2.0,3.0
Kwan,"Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you ""Mannerless Colony Slob""?",2.0,3.0
Aang," Just ""slob"" is fine. Or, uh, Kuzon. ",2.0,3.0
Aang," We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun.",2.0,3.0
On Ji, Don't let the headmaster catch you with that monkey. ,2.0,3.0
Aang, What monkey?,2.0,3.0
On Ji,"Don't worry, I'm not a tattletale. My name's On Ji. I like your headband, by the way.",2.0,3.0
Hide," On Ji, you don't have to baby-sit the new kid.",2.0,3.0
Aang,Wow.  You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about.,2.0,3.0
Hide,"That's right. Now listen, friend. I know you're from the colonies, so I'll say this slowly.  On Ji is my girlfriend.  Don't forget it.",2.0,3.0
Aang, It was nice meeting you.,2.0,3.0
Shoji," I don't believe it, he didn't beat you up. Not even a little.",2.0,3.0
Aang,I guess I'm just lucky.,2.0,3.0
Shoji,We were on our way to play hide and explode. You wanna come?,2.0,3.0
Aang,I'd love to.,2.0,3.0
Katara, Where have you been? We've been worried sick.,2.0,3.0
Aang, I got invited to play with some kids after school.,2.0,3.0
Sokka, After  what  ?!,2.0,3.0
Aang,"I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow.",2.0,3.0
Sokka, Enrolled in  what  ?! ,2.0,3.0
Guard, You again? Stop where you are!  Prince Zuko ...,2.0,3.0
Zuko,"I'm going in for a visit. You're going to stand guard here, and  no one  is going to know about this.  Uncle, it's me. ",2.0,3.0
Sokka,"Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible.",2.0,3.0
Toph,"Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go to school for?",2.0,3.0
Aang,"Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai.  And here's one that I made out of noodles! ",2.0,3.0
Sokka,"Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous.",2.0,3.0
Aang,I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow.,2.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days.",2.0,3.0
Aang,"Flamey-O, Hotman! ",2.0,3.0
Sokka, Flamey-O?,2.0,3.0
Zuko,"You brought this on yourself, you know. We could have returned together. You could have been a hero!  You have no right to judge me, Uncle. I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me.  You're not going to say anything?  You're a crazy old man! You're crazy! And if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter! ",2.0,3.0

Aang,"Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah. ",2.0,3.0
Kwan,"Since it's obviously  hilarious  to mock our national oath, we'll begin with a pop quiz on our great March of Civilization.  Question one: What year did Fire Lord Sozin battle the Air Nation army?  Kuzon?",2.0,3.0
Aang,Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush. ,2.0,3.0
Kwan,"Well, I don't know how  you  could possibly know more than our national history book. Unless you were there a hundred years ago.",2.0,3.0
Aang,I'll just write down my best guess.,2.0,3.0
Music teacher,Kuzon?,2.0,3.0
Aang," I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist.",2.0,3.0
Music teacher,"No, child. That hullabaloo going on with your feet. Is that a nervous disorder?",2.0,3.0
Aang,"I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right?",2.0,3.0
Shoji,"Not really, no.",2.0,3.0
Music teacher,Dancing  is not conducive to a proper learning environment. Young people must have rigid discipline and order.,2.0,3.0
Aang,But what about expressing yourself?,2.0,3.0
Music teacher,"I know sometimes we're so ruled by our love for our nation that we can't control our own bodies.  If you must, you may march in place quietly next time the urge hits you.",2.0,3.0
On Ji," Uh, hi, Kuzon. I really liked that crazy dance you were doing.",2.0,3.0
Aang,Thanks On Ji. I could show it to you again if you like. Ah! ,2.0,3.0
Hide,"What'd you say, colony trash? You're gonna show her something?",2.0,3.0
Aang, Just some dance movements.,2.0,3.0

Katara,Sapphire Fire. Nice to meet you.,2.0,3.0
Headmaster,"Mr. and Mrs ... Fire, your son has been enrolled here for two days and he's already causing problems. He's argued with his history teacher, disrupted music class, and roughed up my star pupil.",2.0,3.0
Katara,My goodness! That doesn't sound like our Kuzon.,2.0,3.0
Headmaster,"That's what any mother would say, Ma'am. Nonetheless, you're forewarned; if he acts up one more time, I'll have him sent to reform school-  by which I mean the coal mines. Are we clear?",2.0,3.0
Sokka,"Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce!  Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime! ",2.0,3.0

Mai,Orange is such an awful color.,2.0,3.0

Azula,No. You did. Just now.,2.0,3.0
Zuko," Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want, Azula?",2.0,3.0
Azula,"Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see Uncle, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just be careful, Dum-Dum.",2.0,3.0
Sokka," That settles it! No more school for you, young man! ",2.0,3.0

Toph,Ha ha! ,2.0,3.0
Aang,"Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom.",2.0,3.0
Sokka,What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?,2.0,3.0
Aang,"I'm gonna throw them,  a secret dance party! ",2.0,3.0
Sokka, Go to your room!,2.0,3.0
Sokka, I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so ... silly.,2.0,3.0
Aang,"Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork! ",2.0,3.0
Toph, They're coming! Everyone stop bending.,2.0,3.0
Aang," Sorry buddy, you should probably wait out back.  I know, you got fancier feet than anybody. And six of 'em! ",2.0,3.0
Aang," Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's!  Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving. ",2.0,3.0
Shoji,Now what do we do?,2.0,3.0
Aang,This is when you start dancing.,2.0,3.0
Male student #1, I don't think my parents want me dancing in a cave ...,2.0,3.0
Male student #2, Yeah! What if someone finds out?! ,2.0,3.0
Aang,"Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.",2.0,3.0
Shoji,"Maybe it was different in the colonies, Kuzon, but we don't do that here.",2.0,3.0
Aang,"Sure you do, you have for generations! It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'.  And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'.",2.0,3.0
Toph, Who knew Twinkle Toes could dance?,2.0,3.0
Zuko," I brought you some komodo chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food. I admit it, I have everything I always wanted, but it's not as all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice.  I think the Avatar is still alive, I  know  he's out there, I'm losing my mind.  Please, Uncle, I'm so confused I need your help.  Forget it, I'll solve it myself! Waste away in here for all I care!

Aang,And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se. ,2.0,3.0
Sokka," Wow, they look pretty good together.",2.0,3.0
Katara," Eh, if that's what you like ... ",2.0,3.0
Aang,"Yeah, that's it! That's the sound of happy feet.  All right, go with that! Everybody freestyle!",2.0,3.0
Katara," I don't know, Aang.  These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I-I'm not sure that I know how to-",2.0,3.0
Aang, Take my hand.,2.0,3.0
Katara, Okay.,2.0,3.0
Katara," Aang, everyone's watching.",2.0,3.0
Aang,Don't worry about them.  It's just you and me right now.,2.0,3.0
Headmaster,"It  is  a dancing party.  You did the right thing by telling me, Hide.",2.0,3.0
Hide," Anytime, Headmaster sir.",2.0,3.0
Male student #1," This is incredible! It's like my inhibitions just disappear!  Okay, they're back again.",2.0,3.0
Headmaster, He's the one we want! The boy with the headband!,2.0,3.0
Aang,Uh-oh. ,2.0,3.0
Male soldier #1,Gotcha! ,2.0,3.0
Shoji,Looking for me?,2.0,3.0

Student,Over here.,2.0,3.0
Headmaster, Stop that!  Stop that!,2.0,3.0
Katara,"We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache, now.",2.0,3.0
Sokka," Oh, no, I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin.",2.0,3.0
Toph," Way to go, dancy pants. I think you really  did  help those kids, you taught them to be free.",2.0,3.0
Aang,"I don't know, it was just a dance party, that's all.",2.0,3.0
Katara,"Well, that was some dance party Aang. ",2.0,3.0
Sokka," Flamey-O, sir ... Flamey-O.",2.0,3.0
Zuko,"You're sure you weren't followed? I've heard about you. They say you're good at what you do, and even better at keeping secrets. The Avatar is alive. I want you to find him, and end him.",2.0,3.0
Aang,"Momo!  Oh Momo!  Hahahahaha! You found me, buddy!  Hey guys, I think this river's polluted. ",3.0,3.0
Toph, Pah! Plegh! ,3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing skills are off the hook!  Get it? Like a fishing hook? ",3.0,3.0
Toph, Too bad your skills aren't  on  the hook.,3.0,3.0
Katara,"It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food,  assuming that'll fit into Sokka's  master  schedule.",3.0,3.0
Sokka,Hmmm ... It's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today.,3.0,3.0
Aang,"Hey, maybe we can get food there! ",3.0,3.0
Aang,"Now you look just like a little hill with horns! Bye, buddy!",3.0,3.0
Toph,I don't feel anything. Where is the village?,3.0,3.0
Sokka,It's in the middle of the river! ,3.0,3.0
Dock,Sure is! My name's Dock. Mind if I ask who you are?,3.0,3.0
Katara,We're um ... from the Earth Kingdom colonies.,3.0,3.0
Dock,"Wow ... Colonials. Hop on, I give you ride in the town.",3.0,3.0
Katara,Why do you guys live on the river? ,3.0,3.0
Dock, Because we're a fishing town. At least that's how it was before the factory moved in.  Army makes their metal there. Moved in a few years ago and started gunking up our river.  Now our little village is struggling to survive.,3.0,3.0
Aang,Thanks for the ride! ,3.0,3.0
Katara, Look at this place.  It's so sad.  We  have  to do something to help.,3.0,3.0
Sokka,"No, we can't waste our time here. We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own.",3.0,3.0
Katara, These people are starving! But you'd turn your back on them?  How can you be so cold and heartless?,3.0,3.0
Sokka," I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic. We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord. ",3.0,3.0
Toph," Hey, loud mouths! Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about  ""taking out the Fire Lord.""",3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first.",3.0,3.0
Katara, I guess so. ,3.0,3.0
Aang,Let's just get what we need and go. ,3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, Dock. You work here too?",3.0,3.0
Xu,I'm not Dock. I'm Xu! Dock's my brother.,3.0,3.0
Aang,But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes.  The only difference is your hat.,3.0,3.0
Xu," Dock works on the docks. That's why we call him, ""Dock"", and I work in the shop, that's why they call me, ""Xu""!",3.0,3.0
Aang,I don't get it.,3.0,3.0
Xu,"Me neither.  What I can getcha?  Hey, I'll give you a special deal. If you buy three fish, I'll give you a clam for free. ",3.0,3.0
Sokka, We'll just take the fish.  Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore? ,3.0,3.0
Dock,"Hey, colonials! My brother says you need a lift. ",3.0,3.0
Little boy,Can you spare some food?,3.0,3.0
Katara, I wish I could help more. ,3.0,3.0
Sokka,Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track.,3.0,3.0
Toph," Finagle away, oh schedule master.",3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day.",3.0,3.0
Katara,Forty  -three  minutes?,3.0,3.0
Sokka," Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse, which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!",3.0,3.0
Toph,Well  I'm  not waking up early.,3.0,3.0
Sokka,Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.,3.0,3.0
Aang,What?,3.0,3.0
Katara,No way!,3.0,3.0
Toph,Forget it!,3.0,3.0
Sokka," I got it, how's this from now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time.",3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning.",3.0,3.0
Aang,What's the matter Katara?,3.0,3.0
Katara,I think Appa's sick.,3.0,3.0
Sokka, What? Appa's sick? That's awful!,3.0,3.0
Toph,"Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much.",3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now.  And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well.",3.0,3.0
Toph,He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water.,3.0,3.0
Aang,"He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy?  His tongue is purple! That can't be good. Katara, can you heal him?",3.0,3.0
Katara,It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in town.,3.0,3.0
Toph,"Is it just me, or does this place seem different?",3.0,3.0
Aang,"Yeah, are the people ... happier?",3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?",3.0,3.0
Xu," Ah, something amazing happened last night. Food was delivered to our village by a mysterious and wonderful person ... the Painted Lady.",3.0,3.0
Katara,The Painted who now?,3.0,3.0
Xu,The Painted Lady.  She's part of our town's lore. They say she's a river spirit who watches over our town in times of need. I always thought she was just a legend. Until now.,3.0,3.0
Sokka,"See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them. All we need is medicine for our sick friend.",3.0,3.0
Xu,"Medicine? Sorry, all the medicine we have goes to the factory. That's why there's so many sick people in our village.",3.0,3.0
Katara,Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest.,3.0,3.0
Sokka, I guess you're right. You got any more food to sell?,3.0,3.0
Xu," Would you like the one-headed fish, or the two-headed fish? ",3.0,3.0
Sokka, Two-headed!  What? You get more for your money that way! ,3.0,3.0
Little boy,"Thank you, Painted Lady.",3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hi, Dock. Is Xu around?",3.0,3.0
Dock/Xu,"Let me check ...  Hey there! Back again, are ya?",3.0,3.0
Toph, We need more food.  Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better.,3.0,3.0
Xu,"Oh, well, that's too bad. Maybe if you guys are lucky, the Painted Lady will visit you in the night, and heal your friend.",3.0,3.0
Sokka," And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along.",3.0,3.0
Xu," Yeah, maybe! You know, last night she visited us again. Healed most of our sick folks.",3.0,3.0
Aang,Is that why this place seems so festive?,3.0,3.0
Dock,"Yep, it's all because of the Painted Lady.",3.0,3.0
Katara,Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ... spirit?,3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was.",3.0,3.0
Katara, Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are.,3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory. ",3.0,3.0
Aang,"Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like ... ",3.0,3.0
Aang and Sokka, Wooooooooo ... ,3.0,3.0
Aang,"What's the matter, buddy?  It's her!  Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!",3.0,3.0
Aang," Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule.  Wait! But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine!  I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends!  Heeey!  My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar. ",3.0,3.0
Katara," Well, hello Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy.",3.0,3.0
Aang,"Yeah, me too. I hate that.  You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive. ",3.0,3.0
Katara," Thank you, but-",3.0,3.0
Aang,You seem familiar too.,3.0,3.0
Katara,A lot of people say that.,3.0,3.0
Aang," No, you  really  seem familiar.",3.0,3.0
Katara,"Look, I really should get going. ",3.0,3.0
Aang,Katara?,3.0,3.0
Katara," Hi, Aang.",3.0,3.0
Aang, You're the Painted Lady?  But how?,3.0,3.0
Katara,"I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village.  But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her. ",3.0,3.0
Aang,"So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait, is Appa even sick?",3.0,3.0
Katara,"He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine!",3.0,3.0
Aang,"I can't believe you lied to everyone, so you could help these people.",3.0,3.0
Katara,"I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have ...",3.0,3.0
Aang," No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero!",3.0,3.0
Katara,"Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do.",3.0,3.0
Aang,You wanna destroy this factory?,3.0,3.0
Katara,"Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently.",3.0,3.0
Katara,"Shhh!  We don't wanna wake Sokka.  Hi, Sokka, we were just out on a morning walk!",3.0,3.0
Sokka," Oh, really? A morning walk?  I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him  purpleising tongue berries!  Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now!",3.0,3.0
Sokka,And how long did you know about this?,3.0,3.0
Aang," Hey, I just found out this morning!",3.0,3.0
Toph, What's going on?,3.0,3.0
Aang,Fire Nation soldiers are heading toward the village!,3.0,3.0
Sokka, What did you do?,3.0,3.0
Katara,I kind of destroyed their factory.,3.0,3.0
Sokka,You  what  ?,3.0,3.0
Katara, It was  your  idea!,3.0,3.0
Sokka,I was joking! I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises!  Did you even think this through? The army is gonna blame the villagers! They're headed there right now to get revenge!,3.0,3.0
Katara,"Well, what was I supposed to do?",3.0,3.0
Sokka,Leave! Do nothing!,3.0,3.0
Katara," No, I will never,  ever  turn my back on people who need me!  I'm going down to that village, and I am gonna do whatever I can.",3.0,3.0
Sokka,"Wait! I'm coming, too.",3.0,3.0
Katara,I thought you didn't want to help.,3.0,3.0
Sokka,"You need me, and I will never turn my back on you.",3.0,3.0
Katara,"Sokka, you really do have a heart. ",3.0,3.0

Mung," Oh, right, the mysterious Painted Lady did it. And I suppose she drew the army emblem on your containers, too.  This is a town of thieves and liars!  Where's your Painted Lady now? We're going to cure the world of this wretched village.",3.0,3.0

Sokka,"Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her!",3.0,3.0
Katara,"Sokka, it's okay.  I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself.",3.0,3.0
Dock,"She's right, but what should we do?",3.0,3.0
Toph, Maybe we can clean the river!,3.0,3.0
Dock,"Yeah, we can clean the river!  Thank you. You know, you're not so bad for a waterbender.",3.0,3.0
Sokka,"You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?",3.0,3.0
Dock,"No problem. Keeping my mouth shut is a personal specialty. My brother Xu, on the other hand, ohh, he's a blabbermouth. ",3.0,3.0
Katara,"So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?",3.0,3.0
Dock,"No, ma'am. I'm going to get my other brother, Bushi. He loves cleaning rivers.  All right, I'm Bushi! Let's get some river cleaning done!",3.0,3.0

Toph,"Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is that we don't get the hero worship anymore. I miss the love.",4.0,3.0
Sokka," Boo-hoo,  poor heroes. ",4.0,3.0
Katara,What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.,4.0,3.0
Sokka,"It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around and  making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, okay?  I can't  do  anything.",4.0,3.0
Katara,That's not true. No one can read a map like you.,4.0,3.0
Toph,I can't read at all!,4.0,3.0

Aang, Nothing. I was just trying to ...,4.0,3.0

Sokka,"Shopping!  Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling.  Hey, how about these? ",4.0,3.0
Aang," What do you think?  Pretty slick, huh?  All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword.",4.0,3.0
Katara,What's a wind sword?,4.0,3.0
Aang,"It's where I get a sword handle and then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade.  Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.",4.0,3.0
Katara, Yeah ... nice.,4.0,3.0
Aang,I'll just stick to what I got.,4.0,3.0
Sokka, Ooh!   That's  what Sokka's talking about.,4.0,3.0
Weapons store shopkeeper,"You have a good eye.  That's an original from Piandao,  the greatest swordsmaster and sword maker in Fire Nation history.  He lives in the big castle up the road from here. ",4.0,3.0
Aang," That's it! That's what you needed all along, Sokka.",4.0,3.0
Sokka,A sword?,4.0,3.0
Aang,"Not the sword, a master.  We've all had masters to help us get better. You should see if you can study with Piandao.",4.0,3.0
Katara, That's a great idea. I could've never gotten to where I am without Master Pakku. Everyone needs a teacher.,4.0,3.0
Toph," I learned from badgermoles. They don't talk, but they're still good teachers.",4.0,3.0
Sokka," It would be nice to be a master sword fighter. All right, I'll talk to him.",4.0,3.0
Fat, Can I help you?,4.0,3.0
Sokka,I've come to train with the master.,4.0,3.0
Fat, You should know The Master turns almost everyone away.  What did you bring him to prove your worth?,4.0,3.0
Sokka," Well, uhh ... ",4.0,3.0
Fat, Right ...  Let's get this over with.,4.0,3.0
Sokka,"Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword.",4.0,3.0
Piandao,Sokka. That's an unusual name.,4.0,3.0
Sokka," Oh, uh, really, uh where I come from, the Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name... for Fire Nation colonials.",4.0,3.0
Piandao, Let me guess. You've come hundreds of miles from your little village where you're the best swordsman in town. And you think you deserve to learn from the master.,4.0,3.0
Sokka," Well, actually, I've been all over the world.",4.0,3.0
Piandao," Yep, here we go.",4.0,3.0
Sokka, And I know one thing for sure:  I have a lot to learn.,4.0,3.0
Piandao, You're not doing a very good job of selling yourself.,4.0,3.0
Sokka," I know. Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth.  But the truth is... I don't know if I am worthy.",4.0,3.0
Piandao," Hm, I see.  Well, then,  let's find out together how worthy you are.",4.0,3.0
Piandao,I  will  train you.,4.0,3.0
Piandao, The first thing you must learn is that your weapon is an extension of yourself.  You must think of it as another part of your own body.,4.0,3.0
Sokka, Like a second head.,4.0,3.0
Piandao," Well, more like an extra-long, really sharp arm.  The sword is a simple tool, but in the hands of a master it becomes  the most versatile of weapons,  and just as the imagination is limitless,  so too are the possibilities of the sword.",4.0,3.0
Aang,What should we do today‌?,4.0,3.0
Toph,"I'm tapped out. I already picked my toes, twice.",4.0,3.0
Aang,Twice?,4.0,3.0
Toph,"The first time was for cleaning, but the second time's just for the  sweet picking sensation!",4.0,3.0
Katara,Sokka's been in charge of the schedule. I'm not sure what we should be doing.,4.0,3.0
Toph," Plus, it's so hot today.",4.0,3.0
Aang, How hot is it?,4.0,3.0
Toph,I dunno. Real hot‌?,4.0,3.0
Katara," I-It's so hot, it's  so  hot ... Momo is shedding like Appa.  Huh, huh‌?",4.0,3.0
Aang,I guess the jokes don't run in the family.,4.0,3.0
Katara,"Oh, everyone's a critic.",4.0,3.0
Piandao,The warrior practices a variety of arts to keep his mind sharp and fluid.  The first you will learn is calligraphy.  Write your name.,4.0,3.0
Sokka, Writing my name will make me a better swordsman‌?,4.0,3.0
Piandao," When you write your name, you stamp the paper with your identity. You must learn to use your sword to stamp your identity on a battlefield.  Remember, you cannot take back a stroke of the brush, or a stroke of the sword.",4.0,3.0
Piandao, You are getting ink on your face.,4.0,3.0
Sokka," I am?  I am! So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?",4.0,3.0
Piandao,Landscape painting teaches a warrior to hold the lay of the land in his mind.,4.0,3.0
Piandao,"In battle, you only have an instant to take everything in.",4.0,3.0
Piandao,"Now, paint it.",4.0,3.0
Piandao,And no peeking.,4.0,3.0
Sokka,I'm finished!,4.0,3.0
Piandao, You added a rainbow.,4.0,3.0

Piandao,"I'll take a slice of lemon in mine, please.",4.0,3.0
Warden Poon,What's going on in there‌?,4.0,3.0
Warden Poon,Crazy old man.,4.0,3.0
Katara,So where are we going next‌?  We're starting from here ...,4.0,3.0
Aang," No, we're over on this island.",4.0,3.0
Toph, You noodle-brains don't know what you're doing. I miss Sokka.,4.0,3.0
Katara,"Ooh, I got one: if you miss him so much, why don't you marry him‌?",4.0,3.0
Piandao,You've had a good first day of training.,4.0,3.0
Sokka, I have‌? But I thought I messed up every single thing we worked on!,4.0,3.0
Piandao, You messed things up in a very special way. You are ready for a real sword.,4.0,3.0
Sokka, Are you giving me one of yours‌?,4.0,3.0
Piandao, No.,4.0,3.0
Piandao," Your sword must be an extension of yourself. So tomorrow, you will make your own sword.",4.0,3.0
Piandao,Choosing the correct material is the most important step in crafting a sword.  You must trust your steel with your life. Choose carefully.,4.0,3.0
Sokka,"Master,  would it be possible for me to leave and bring back a special material for my sword‌?",4.0,3.0
Piandao, I wouldn't have it any other way.,4.0,3.0
Toph, Sokka's coming!,4.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, guys. What are you doing‌?",4.0,3.0
Aang,Sokka!,4.0,3.0
Toph,You're back!,4.0,3.0
Katara, We missed you so much!,4.0,3.0
Aang, Say something funny!,4.0,3.0
Sokka, Funny how‌?,4.0,3.0
Sokka, What's their deal‌?,4.0,3.0
Toph, I don't know. They missed you or something. I didn't care. ,4.0,3.0
Sokka," Thanks. That warms my heart. Anyway, I need some help.",4.0,3.0
Piandao,Who's this‌?,4.0,3.0
Sokka," Oh, these are my friends. Just other good Fire Nation folks.  Do you think we can make a sword out of a meteorite‌?",4.0,3.0
Piandao, We'll make a sword unlike any other in the world.,4.0,3.0
Piandao,"Sokka, when you first arrived, you were so unsure. You even seemed down on yourself.  But I saw something in you right away.  I saw a heart as strong as a lion turtle, and twice as big.  And as we trained, it wasn't your skills that impressed me.  No, it certainly wasn't your skills.  You showed something beyond that.  Creativity, versatility,  intelligence ...  these are the traits that define a great swordsman.  And these are the traits that define you.  You told me you didn't know if you were worthy,  but I believe that you are more worthy than any man I have ever trained.",4.0,3.0
Sokka,"I'm sorry, Master. You're wrong.  I am not worthy.  I'm not who you think I am. I'm not from the Fire Nation. I'm from the Southern Water Tribe.  I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you. I'm sorry. ",4.0,3.0
Piandao," I'm sorry, too.",4.0,3.0
Sokka,"No, this is my fight, alone.",4.0,3.0

Piandao,Excellent!  Using your superior agility against an older opponent ... smart.,4.0,3.0
Piandao,Good use of terrain ... fighting from the high ground.,4.0,3.0
Piandao,"Yes, use your surroundings.  Make them fight for you!",4.0,3.0
Piandao,Very resourceful.,4.0,3.0
Piandao,"Excellent work, Sokka.",4.0,3.0
Piandao,I think I'm a little old to be fighting the Avatar.,4.0,3.0
Aang,How did you know‌?,4.0,3.0
Piandao,"Oh, I've been around a while. You pick things up.  Of course, I knew from the beginning that Sokka was Water Tribe.  You might want to think of a better Fire Nation cover name.  Try ""Lee."" There's a million ""Lees"". .",4.0,3.0
Katara,But why would you agree to train someone from the Water Tribe‌?,4.0,3.0
Piandao," The way of the sword doesn't belong to any one nation.  Knowledge of the arts belongs to us all.  Sokka, you must continue your training on your own.  If you stay on this path, I know that one day  you will become an even greater master than I am.",4.0,3.0
Fat,"Wait!  The Master wanted you to have this, as something to remember him by.",4.0,3.0

Toph, Sweet!  Check this out.,4.0,3.0
Katara,"You know, I don't think there's such a thing as ""space earth"". If it's from space, then it's not really ""earth"".",4.0,3.0
Sokka,Must you ruin everything‌?,4.0,3.0
Katara,I can't believe I missed you.,4.0,3.0

Azula,"See that girl with the silly pigtails? When she runs toward the ball,  there's just the slightest hesitation of her left foot. I'm willing to bet a childhood injury has weakened her.  Keep serving the ball to her left, and we'll  destroy  her and the rest of her team.  Dismissed.",5.0,3.0

Ty Lee, What are you talking about?,5.0,3.0
Azula," Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them. You're not a challenge. You're a tease. It's not like they actually care who you are.  Okay, okay, calm down. I didn't mean what I said.  Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little ...  jealous.",5.0,3.0
Ty Lee," What? You're jealous of me? But you're the most beautiful, smartest, perfect girl in the world.",5.0,3.0

Zuko,Sure. ,5.0,3.0
Azula,"Chan, I'm ready for a tour of the house.",5.0,3.0
Chan,Is this your first time on Ember Island?,5.0,3.0
Azula,No. I used to come here years ago.,5.0,3.0
Chan," It's a great place, if you like sand.  Yeah, it's like, welcome to Sandy Land!",5.0,3.0
Azula,Your arms look  so  strong.,5.0,3.0
Chan,"Yeah, I know.  You're pretty.",5.0,3.0
Azula," Together,  you and I will be the strongest couple in the entire world!  We will  dominate  the Earth!",5.0,3.0
Chan, Uh ... I got to go.,5.0,3.0
Zuko," Hey, watch it! That food was for my cranky girlfriend!",5.0,3.0
Ruon-Jian,What are you doing?,5.0,3.0
Zuko, Stop talking to my girlfriend!,5.0,3.0
Ruon-Jian, Relax. It's just a party.,5.0,3.0
Mai," Zuko, what is wrong with you?",5.0,3.0
Zuko,What's wrong with  me  ?,5.0,3.0
Mai, Your temper is out of control. You blow up over every little thing. You're so impatient and hotheaded and angry!,5.0,3.0
Zuko," Well, at least I feel something, as opposed to you.  You have no passion for anything! You're just a big blah!",5.0,3.0
Mai," It's over, Zuko. We're done.",5.0,3.0
Chan, Who broke my nana's vase?  That's it! You're out of here!,5.0,3.0
Zuko, I was just leaving.,5.0,3.0
Ruon-Jian," Have fun by yourself,  loser boy  .",5.0,3.0
Chan,Nice  .,5.0,3.0
Toph,"Guys, you're all gonna think I'm crazy, but it feels like a metal man is coming.",5.0,3.0
Azula,I thought I'd find you here.,5.0,3.0
Zuko, Those summers we spent here seem so long ago. So much has changed.,5.0,3.0
Azula,Come down to the beach with me. Come on. This place is depressing.,5.0,3.0
Mai, Hey.,5.0,3.0
Zuko, Where's your new boyfriend?  Are you cold? ,5.0,3.0
Ty Lee,I'm  freezing  .,5.0,3.0
Zuko, I'll make a fire.  There's plenty of stuff to burn in  there  .,5.0,3.0
Sokka,This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?,5.0,3.0
Aang, We can't! Jump on Appa! I'll try to distract him!,5.0,3.0
Aang,I'm okay. ,5.0,3.0
Toph,"Well, that was random.",5.0,3.0
Katara, I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are.,5.0,3.0
Ty Lee,What are you doing?,5.0,3.0
Zuko, What does it look like I'm doing?,5.0,3.0
Ty Lee," But, it's a painting of your family.",5.0,3.0
Zuko, You think I care?,5.0,3.0
Ty Lee, I think you do.,5.0,3.0
Zuko,"You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business? ",5.0,3.0
Ty Lee, I know you.,5.0,3.0
Zuko," No, you don't.  You're stuck in your little ""Ty Lee world"" where everything's great all the time.",5.0,3.0
Mai,"Zuko,  leave her alone.",5.0,3.0
Zuko," ""I'm so pretty. Look at me. I can walk on my hands. Whoo!""  Circus freak.",5.0,3.0
Ty Lee," Yes, I'm a circus freak. Go ahead and laugh all you want. You want to know  why  I joined the circus?",5.0,3.0
Azula,Here we go.,5.0,3.0
Ty Lee," Do you have any idea what my home life was like?  Growing up with six sisters who look exactly like me?  It was like I didn't even have my own name.  I joined the circus  because I was scared of spending the rest of my life as part of a matched set. At least I'm different now.  ""Circus freak"" is a compliment.",5.0,3.0
Mai," Guess that explains why you need ten boyfriends, too.",5.0,3.0
Ty Lee," I'm sorry, what?",5.0,3.0
Mai," Attention issues. You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid, so you're trying to make up for it now.",5.0,3.0
Ty Lee," Well, what's  your  excuse, Mai? You were an only child for fifteen years, but even with all that attention, your aura is this dingy, pasty, gray ...",5.0,3.0
Mai, I don't believe in auras.,5.0,3.0
Zuko," Yeah, you do not believe in anything.",5.0,3.0
Mai," Oh, well, I'm sorry I can't be as high-strung and crazy as the rest of you.",5.0,3.0
Zuko," I'm sorry, too. I wish you  would  be high-strung and crazy for once instead of keeping all your feeling bottled up inside.  She just called your aura dingy. Are you gonna take that?",5.0,3.0
Mai," What do you want from me? You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't.  I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted ... as long as I behaved  and sat still, and didn't speak unless spoken to.  My mother said I had to keep out of trouble. We had my dad's political career to think about.",5.0,3.0
Azula," Well, that's it, then.  You have a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them, you were shut down. That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself.",5.0,3.0
Mai, You want me to express myself?  Leave me alone!,5.0,3.0
Zuko, I like it when you express yourself. ,5.0,3.0
Mai, Don't touch me! I'm still mad at you. ,5.0,3.0
Zuko," My life hasn't been that easy either, Mai.",5.0,3.0
Mai,Whatever. That doesn't excuse the way you've been acting.,5.0,3.0
Ty Lee,"Calm down, you guys.  This much negative energy is bad for your skin. You'll totally break out.",5.0,3.0
Zuko,Bad skin?   Normal  teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury.  My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my  face  ! ,5.0,3.0
Ty Lee," Sorry, Zuko, I ...",5.0,3.0
Zuko," For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home now, my dad talks to me. Ha! He even thinks I'm a hero.  Everything should be perfect, right?  I should be happy now, but I'm not.  I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why!",5.0,3.0
Azula," There's a simple question you need to answer, then. Who are you angry at?",5.0,3.0
Zuko, No one. I'm just angry.,5.0,3.0
Mai," Yeah, who are you angry at, Zuko?",5.0,3.0
Zuko, Everyone. I don't know. ,5.0,3.0
Azula, Is it Dad?,5.0,3.0
Zuko," No, no.",5.0,3.0
Ty Lee, Your uncle?,5.0,3.0
Azula,Me?,5.0,3.0
Zuko," No, no, n-no, no!",5.0,3.0
Mai, Then who? Who are you angry at?,5.0,3.0
Azula," Answer the question, Zuko.",5.0,3.0
Ty Lee, Talk to us.,5.0,3.0
Mai," Come on, answer the question.",5.0,3.0
Azula,"Come on, answer it.",5.0,3.0
Zuko, I'm angry at myself!,5.0,3.0
Azula,Why?,5.0,3.0
Zuko, Because I'm confused. Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.,5.0,3.0
Azula,You're pathetic.,5.0,3.0
Mai, I know one thing I care about.  I care about you. ,5.0,3.0
Azula," Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone.",5.0,3.0
Zuko," I guess you wouldn't understand, would you, Azula?  Because you're just  so  perfect.",5.0,3.0
Azula," Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care.  My own mother  thought I was a monster.  She was right, of course, but it still hurt.",5.0,3.0
Ty Lee,What Lo and Li said came true. The beach did help us learn about ourselves.  I feel all smoothed. I'll always remember this.,5.0,3.0
Azula, You know what would make this trip  really  memorable?,5.0,3.0
Azula," We've got some bad news, Chan.",5.0,3.0
Zuko, Party's over.,5.0,3.0
Roku,"Aang, it's time you learn of my history with Fire Lord Sozin.  You need to understand how the war began, if you want to know how to end it.  Meet me on my home island on the day of the summer solstice.",6.0,3.0
Aang," Okay, Roku.",6.0,3.0
Zuko, You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise. It will reveal your own destiny. ,6.0,3.0
Aang,There it is. That's Roku's home.,6.0,3.0
Katara," But, there's nothing here.",6.0,3.0
Toph,"Yes, there is. An entire village, hundreds of houses ...  all completely buried in ash.",6.0,3.0
Azula,"It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko. Make sure he gets your good side.",6.0,3.0
Zuko,"Wait, I need to ask you something.  What do you remember about our great-grandfather's history?",6.0,3.0
Azula," Oh, Zuko, it's so strange how your mind works.  Fire Lord Sozin began the war, of course.  He spent his early years secretly preparing for it. He was as patient as he was clever. He famously waited for the comet, later renamed Sozin's Comet, and used its power to launch his full-scale invasion of the world.  In the end, he died a very old and successful man.",6.0,3.0
Zuko,But how did he die?,6.0,3.0
Azula," Didn't you pay  any  attention in school, Zuko? He died peacefully, in his sleep.  He was ancient.",6.0,3.0
Zuko,What does it mean?,6.0,3.0
Zuko, The Fire Sages keep the secret history in the Dragonbone Catacombs.,6.0,3.0
Zuko, The final testimony of Fire Lord Sozin.,6.0,3.0
Roku,"Come, Aang.",6.0,3.0
Aang, Where're we going?,6.0,3.0
Roku,To visit my past.  Our shared past.,6.0,3.0
Sozin," As I feel my own life dimming, I can't help but think of a time when everything was so much brighter.",6.0,3.0
Sozin,I remember my friend.,6.0,3.0
Sozin,"Looks like I win again, Roku. ",6.0,3.0
Roku,"Are you kidding?  The tree root did all the work.  Nice one, Sozin.",6.0,3.0
Aang, You were friends with Fire Lord Sozin‌?,6.0,3.0
Roku,"Back then, he was just  Prince  Sozin.  And he was my best friend.",6.0,3.0
Sozin, Say something to her.,6.0,3.0
Roku,Love is hard when you are young.,6.0,3.0
Aang,You don't have to tell me.,6.0,3.0
Roku," Don't worry, it gets better.  Now, come with me.  We have a party to attend.",6.0,3.0
Aang,"Wait, whose party is it?",6.0,3.0
Roku," Sozin and I shared many things, including a birthday.",6.0,3.0
Sozin,Did something happen to my father?,6.0,3.0
Fire Sage,"No, Prince Sozin. We are not here for you.  We're here to announce the identity of the next Avatar.  It is our honor to serve you, Avatar Roku.",6.0,3.0
Sozin,Soon the day came when my friend Roku had to leave the Fire Nation and face his destiny as the Avatar.  He needed to travel the world so he could master the other elements.,6.0,3.0
Sozin,"Hey, why aren't you packed yet, all-powerful Avatar?",6.0,3.0
Sozin," Come on, show me how it's done using all four kinds of bending.",6.0,3.0
Roku,"I started packing, but then the Fire Sages told me I won't need any worldly possessions anymore.",6.0,3.0
Sozin,Oh. ,6.0,3.0
Roku,It happened so fast. Everything's gonna be different now.,6.0,3.0
Sozin,"Here, hope you're at least allowed to have this. ",6.0,3.0
Roku,But this is a royal artifact.  It's supposed to be worn by the Crown Prince.,6.0,3.0
Sozin,I want you to have it.,6.0,3.0
Katara,Do they have bathrooms in the Spirit World?,6.0,3.0
Sokka," As a matter of fact, they do not.",6.0,3.0
Aang," Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple!",6.0,3.0
Roku,This was the first stop on my Avatar journey.,6.0,3.0
Roku,It was the place where I was trained to master airbending.,6.0,3.0
Roku,And also where I met an old friend of yours: Monk Gyatso.,6.0,3.0
Aang,No way!,6.0,3.0
Roku,"Hey, Gyatso, you wanna see a new glider trick? ",6.0,3.0
Gyatso, Check this out! ,6.0,3.0
Aang,He's air surfing! I can't believe I never thought of that.,6.0,3.0
Aang, That's amazing! I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was!,6.0,3.0
Roku," Some friendships are so strong,  they can even transcend lifetimes.",6.0,3.0
Roku,"After my years mastering airbending, I traveled to the Northern Water Tribe.",6.0,3.0
Roku,"Waterbending was especially challenging for me. But in time, I mastered it as well.",6.0,3.0
Roku,I moved on to the Earth Kingdom.,6.0,3.0
Roku,"My earthbending master, Sud, was uncompromising, stubborn, and blunt ...",6.0,3.0
Roku,... And a lifelong friend.,6.0,3.0
Roku,It was bitter work ...  but the results were worth it. ,6.0,3.0
Sozin,"Twelve long years passed before I saw my friend again. When Roku returned, he was a fully realized Avatar, and I had changed as well.",6.0,3.0
Roku,"Sozin! Or should I say, Fire Lord!",6.0,3.0
Sozin," Customarily, my subjects bow before greeting me.  But you're the exception. ",6.0,3.0
Roku,"After all these years, he was still my best friend.  And a few months later, he was my best man.",6.0,3.0
Aang," Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you're alive!",6.0,3.0
Roku,"Ta Min. I was persistent.  When love is real, it finds a way.  And being the Avatar doesn't hurt your chances with the ladies, either.",6.0,3.0
Sozin,"On wedding days, we look to the future with optimism and joy.  I had my own vision for a brighter future.",6.0,3.0
Sozin, Excuse me. May I borrow him for a moment‌?,6.0,3.0
Ta Min,"It's not very traditional, but, okay.",6.0,3.0
Roku,What's on your mind?,6.0,3.0
Sozin, I've been thinking hard about the state of the world lately.,6.0,3.0
Roku," Sozin, it is my wedding! Have a cookie, dance with someone, lighten up!",6.0,3.0
Sozin," I know, I know, but just hear me out.  Right from the start, I was destined to be Fire Lord. And although we didn't always know it, you were destined to be the Avatar.  It's an amazing stroke of fate we know each other so well, isn't it? Together, we could do ...  anything  .",6.0,3.0
Roku," Yeah, we could.",6.0,3.0
Sozin," Our nation is enjoying an unprecedented time of peace and wealth. Our people are happy, and we're so fortunate in so many ways.",6.0,3.0
Roku, Where are you going with this?,6.0,3.0
Sozin,"I've been thinking, we should share this prosperity with the rest of the world.  In our hands is the most successful empire in history.  It's time we expanded it.",6.0,3.0
Roku,No! The four nations are meant to be just that: four.,6.0,3.0
Sozin," Roku, you haven't even stopped to consider the possibilities.",6.0,3.0
Roku, There are no possibilities. This is the last I want to hear  about this. ,6.0,3.0
Roku," That was my first real test as the Avatar. Unfortunately, it was many years before I learned  that Sozin  had gone ahead with his plan, despite my warning.",6.0,3.0
Roku," I've seen the colonies, Sozin.  How dare you occupy Earth Kingdom territory!",6.0,3.0
Sozin," How dare you, a citizen of the Fire Nation, address your Fire Lord this way.  Your loyalty is to our nation first. Anything less makes you a traitor.",6.0,3.0
Roku,"Don't do this, Sozin. Don't challenge me. It will only end badly. It's over.",6.0,3.0
Roku,"I'm sparing you, Sozin.  I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship. But I warn you.  Even a single step out of line will result in your  permanent  end.",6.0,3.0
Roku,"Sozin and I didn't speak or see each other for twenty-five years after our battle.  I spent most of my spare time here, at my home.",6.0,3.0
Roku,Let's go! ,6.0,3.0
Sozin,Roku's island was a hundred miles away. But I could still feel it rumbling and see the black plume of smoke. I had never seen anything like this catastrophe.,6.0,3.0
Aang,"This is amazing, Roku! You're battling a volcano, and you're winning.",6.0,3.0
Roku,"Unfortunately, my success didn't last long, Aang. There was no way I could do it all.",6.0,3.0
Roku," Battling the elements was hard enough. I had to do it while I could barely breathe. The poisonous, volcanic gases were overwhelming.",6.0,3.0
Roku, It's all right Fang!  Get out of here! I'm fine!,6.0,3.0
Sozin,"Need a hand, old friend?",6.0,3.0
Roku, Sozin?,6.0,3.0
Sozin,There's not a moment to waste.,6.0,3.0
Roku,Don't breathe the toxic gas.,6.0,3.0
Roku, It's too much.,6.0,3.0
Roku,Please.,6.0,3.0
Sozin,"Without you, all my plans are suddenly possible.  I have a vision for the future, Roku.",6.0,3.0
Aang,"Who's ... wait, that's me, isn't it? ",6.0,3.0
Roku,"Make sense of our past, Aang.  And you will bring peace, and restore balance in the world. ",6.0,3.0
Aang,Roku? Roku!,6.0,3.0
Sozin,"With Roku gone, and the great comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the world.  I knew the next Avatar would be born an Air Nomad. So I wiped out the Air Temples.  But somehow, the new Avatar eluded me.  I wasted the remainder of my life searching in vain.  I know he's hiding out there somewhere.  The Fire Nation's greatest threat ... the last airbender.",6.0,3.0
Zuko,That can't be it! Where's the rest of it? ,6.0,3.0
Zuko," You sent this, didn't you? I found the secret history, which by the way should be renamed history most people already know! The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end.",6.0,3.0
Iroh, No. He wasn't.,6.0,3.0
Zuko, What are you talking about?,6.0,3.0
Iroh,"You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather.  Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.",6.0,3.0
Zuko, Why are you telling me this?,6.0,3.0
Iroh,"Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself.  Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side.  What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by  you  . Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore  balance  to the world.",6.0,3.0
Iroh,This is a royal artifact. It's supposed to be worn  by the Crown Prince.,6.0,3.0
Katara,"You mean, after all Roku and Sozin went through together, even after Roku showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that‌?",6.0,3.0
Toph, It's like these people are born bad.,6.0,3.0
Aang," No, that's wrong. I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all.",6.0,3.0
Sokka, Then what  was  the point?,6.0,3.0
Aang," Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil.  Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance.  And I also think it was about friendships.",6.0,3.0
Toph, Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?,6.0,3.0
Aang, I don't see why not.,6.0,3.0
Sokka,"Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ...",6.0,3.0
Katara," Oh, Sokka, just hold hands.",6.0,3.0
Toph, How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!,7.0,3.0
Katara, You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. ,7.0,3.0
Aang,Okay. I'm ready for some training.,7.0,3.0
Toph,"Good job, Twinkle Toes. Visualize, then attack.",7.0,3.0
Katara,"Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph!",7.0,3.0
Toph,"What's the matter? Can't handle a little dirt, Madame Fussy-Britches?",7.0,3.0
Katara,"Oh, sorry. Did I splash you, Mud-Slug?",7.0,3.0
Aang,Are we taking a break?,7.0,3.0
Sokka, Sneak Attack!,7.0,3.0
Aang," Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud.",7.0,3.0
Toph,Hungry for a mud pie? ,7.0,3.0
Katara, I'll give you a mud pie!,7.0,3.0
Aang,"Uh guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me.",7.0,3.0
Katara," Very well, pupil. I believe we've had enough training for today. ",7.0,3.0
Toph,"While Katara cleans up,  let's go have some fun!",7.0,3.0
Aang,Yeah!,7.0,3.0
Sokka, Yes!,7.0,3.0
Sokka,"Look at all those messenger hawks! You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. I could just send them messages.",7.0,3.0
Toph,"I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you. ",7.0,3.0
Aang," So, guys. What are we gonna get with our last silver piece?",7.0,3.0
Toph, We can get more money.  Right there. ,7.0,3.0
Toph,This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage. Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute. But I can feel it with my earthbending. ,7.0,3.0
Dealer, You there. Wanna play a friendly game?,7.0,3.0
Toph,How can I possibly play?  I'm blind.,7.0,3.0
Dealer,You don't have to see to be lucky.,7.0,3.0
Aang,"Flamey-O, Toph.",7.0,3.0
Dealer,Wow. Fancy guessing. You are amazing at this.  Would you like to make the game a little more interesting?,7.0,3.0
Toph, More interesting? How?,7.0,3.0
Dealer," Well, let's say you toss in your friend's fine sword there,  then I'll put up twenty silver pieces against it, and that's more interesting.",7.0,3.0
Toph, I'll do it for forty silver pieces. ,7.0,3.0
Dealer,Forty silver pieces it is. ,7.0,3.0
Dealer," Sorry, little lady, but-  Huh? ",7.0,3.0
Toph,I won! ,7.0,3.0
Katara,Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff?,7.0,3.0
Aang,Toph got us money.  She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like. ,7.0,3.0
Sokka, She used earthbending to win the game! Classic!,7.0,3.0
Katara,"Ah, so she cheated.",7.0,3.0
Toph, Hey! I only cheated because he was cheating!  I cheated a cheater.  What's wrong with that?,7.0,3.0
Katara,I'm just saying this isn't something we should make a habit of doing.,7.0,3.0
Toph,Why? Because it's fun? And you hate fun?,7.0,3.0
Katara,I don't hate fun!  See? Fun! ,7.0,3.0
Aang," Katara,  I'll personally make you an Avatar Promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams.",7.0,3.0
Katara,"Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough. If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen.",7.0,3.0
Toph,Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up? ,7.0,3.0
Katara," Oh, I'm sorry! You think I should be more like you? Like some wild child? ",7.0,3.0
Toph,"Yeah! Maybe! Maybe then you'd see  how great we have it! I mean, look at us!  We're traveling around the world! Making easy money! Having fun! With no parents to tell us what to do!",7.0,3.0
Katara,Ah. I see. You're acting like this because of your parents.,7.0,3.0
Toph,Whatever.,7.0,3.0
Katara,"They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist. You act like you hate them, but you don't. You just feel guilty.",7.0,3.0
Toph,I  do  hate them.,7.0,3.0
Katara,"I don't think so. I think you miss them, but you just don't wanna deal with that, so instead you act like this crazy person.",7.0,3.0
Toph," Look, I ran away to help Aang!",7.0,3.0
Katara,"You know what? It doesn't matter. These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that.  We've already got some third-eyed freak after us.",7.0,3.0
Sokka,"Speaking of that ""third-eyed freak"", I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of ""Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man""?  Just think about it.",7.0,3.0
Katara, We have enough money! You need to stop this!,7.0,3.0
Toph, I'll stop when I wanna stop and not when you tell me! ,7.0,3.0
Sokka," Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some. See you guys later. ",7.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any fighting.  Good little messenger hawky. Who's got pretty feathers?  You're right, Hawky. This is bad. ",7.0,3.0
Sokka,"Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like. ",7.0,3.0
Toph,"Well it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper.",7.0,3.0
Sokka,It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you the Runaway.,7.0,3.0
Toph," A wanted poster! That's so great! ""The Runaway."" I love my new nickname. Is there a picture of me? Does it look good?",7.0,3.0
Sokka," Well yeah, actually, it does look pretty good.  But, Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us.",7.0,3.0
Toph,Don't be such a worrywart like your sister.  Think of it this way: Now you've got plenty of money to help with the invasion plan. ,7.0,3.0
Sokka," Well, that is true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa. ",7.0,3.0
Toph," Here's a little extra, so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know what?  Make it an atlas.",7.0,3.0
Sokka, I do like expensive atlases.,7.0,3.0
Toph,Of course you do.  And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret. ,7.0,3.0
Katara,"Sokka,  tell me you didn't buy a bird.",7.0,3.0
Sokka,"Not just a bird, a messenger bird. Now we can send messages all over the world. Even to Gran Gran.",7.0,3.0
Aang," Wow, how does it work?",7.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hm. Uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky,  Gran Gran, South Pole.  I think he gets it.",7.0,3.0
Sokka,Hawky! Make nice! Bad Hawky!,7.0,3.0
Katara, Well. Look who decided to join us.  Where have you two been? Off scamming again?,7.0,3.0
Toph,"Yes, we were. ",7.0,3.0
Katara, And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?,7.0,3.0
Toph,"No, I don't.",7.0,3.0
Katara,Really?,7.0,3.0
Toph,Yes. Really.,7.0,3.0
Katara, Well then. What's this? ,7.0,3.0
Toph," I don't know! I mean, seriously! What is with you people? I'm  blind  ! ",7.0,3.0
Katara,"It's a wanted poster of you! ""The Runaway!"" Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this?",7.0,3.0
Toph, Where did you get that!?,7.0,3.0
Katara,It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is-,7.0,3.0
Toph,You went through my stuff! You had no right!,7.0,3.0
Katara,"Your stuff was messy and I was just straightening up, and I happened to stumble across it!",7.0,3.0
Toph,"That's a lie!  You're lying, Katara!",7.0,3.0
Katara," Fine! It's a lie! But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up! I knew you were hiding something and you were!  Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!",7.0,3.0
Toph," Oh really, Mom? Or what are you gonna do? Send me to my room?",7.0,3.0
Katara,I wish I could!,7.0,3.0
Toph,"Well you can't! Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom! ",7.0,3.0
Katara,I never said I was!,7.0,3.0
Toph,"No, but you certainly act like it! You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not! You're just a regular kid like the rest of us! So stop acting like you can tell me what to do! I can do whatever I want!",7.0,3.0
Katara,"I don't act that way!  Sokka, do I act motherly?",7.0,3.0
Sokka, Hey. I'm staying out of this one.,7.0,3.0
Katara," What do you think, Aang? Do I act like a mom?",7.0,3.0
Aang," Well. I, uh-",7.0,3.0
Katara, Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!,7.0,3.0
Aang," Yes, ma'am.",7.0,3.0
Toph,I can't be around you right now!,7.0,3.0

Sokka,"Hey, Aang. You wanna test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea.",7.0,3.0
Aang,Sure. ,7.0,3.0
Sokka," I'm going to send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again.",7.0,3.0
Aang,"I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas.",7.0,3.0
Sokka,"It's a gift.  ""Dear Katara, sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph.""",7.0,3.0
Katara,"I know this is from you, Sokka! Toph can't write!  Ugh! You're all driving me crazy! ",7.0,3.0
Aang,I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.,7.0,3.0
Sokka,Yup. We're idiots. ,7.0,3.0
Aang,I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.,7.0,3.0
Sokka,"I think we're gonna run into a similar problem.  Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help.  Come on. We need to talk.",7.0,3.0
Toph,So lemme guess: You brought me out here to tell me that your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.,7.0,3.0
Sokka,"Nah, she's pretty much a pain.  She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ...",7.0,3.0
Toph,Yeah. I don't know how you could deal with it.,7.0,3.0
Sokka,"Actually, in a way, I rely on it. ",7.0,3.0
Toph,I don't understand.,7.0,3.0
Sokka,"When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.",7.0,3.0
Toph,I guess I never thought about that.,7.0,3.0
Sokka,"I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly? I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture. ",7.0,3.0
Toph,"The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me.  You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom.  Don't ever tell her I said any of this!",7.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, my lips are sealed.",7.0,3.0
Katara,"Hi, Toph. Um, I wanna-",7.0,3.0
Toph," Katara, stop. You don't need to apologize. I was the one being stupid. These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them.",7.0,3.0
Katara, Actually I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say ... I wanna pull a scam with you. ,7.0,3.0
Toph, What?  You  wanna pull a scam?,7.0,3.0
Katara,"Not just any scam. The  ultimate  scam.  Whaddaya say, Toph? Just me and you. One last go. You in?",7.0,3.0
Toph, You  know  I'm in! Now what's this idea of yours? ,7.0,3.0
Katara,"The plan is simple: This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money; Ten times more than you've made in all of your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way. ",7.0,3.0
Toph, How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!,7.0,3.0
Katara, You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. ,7.0,3.0
Town authority,You did the right thing by turning in the Runaway.,7.0,3.0
Katara,The right thing is its own reward.,7.0,3.0
Town authority,"Well, I'm happy to hear you say that.",7.0,3.0
Katara," But, I still want the actual reward.",7.0,3.0
Town authority,Of course. Right this way.,7.0,3.0
Toph,Hey! What kind of cell is this?,7.0,3.0
Female guard,A wooden one. ,7.0,3.0
Town authority,That's her! That's the girl you were looking for!,7.0,3.0
Aang,Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?,7.0,3.0
Sokka,I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out.  You two behave.  Appa's in charge. ,7.0,3.0
Toph,Wait! It's a trap!,7.0,3.0
Katara," Really? No kidding! Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?",7.0,3.0
Toph,"Not for us, Katara! We're the bait! He wants Aang! ",7.0,3.0
Katara,I can't believe I'm so stupid! See? This is exactly why I'm against these scams! I knew this would happen!,7.0,3.0
Toph,"But, this was  your  idea.",7.0,3.0
Katara,I know. I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.,7.0,3.0
Toph,"Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with.",7.0,3.0
Katara,I know your relationship with your parents is complicated. And I shouldn't have said what I said.,7.0,3.0
Toph,"It's okay. I was really mad when you said that because ... well because, maybe it's true.  I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them.",7.0,3.0
Sokka,Where do you think they might be?,7.0,3.0
Aang,"Where do you think anyone is?  Sokka, watch out!  It's Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man!",7.0,3.0
Sokka,"You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit.",7.0,3.0
Katara,What are we gonna do?,7.0,3.0
Toph,I don't know. I wish we had some earth or water. We need bendables.,7.0,3.0
Katara,What about your meteor bracelet? You can make a saw.,7.0,3.0
Toph,I left it back at camp.  I was worried they would take it.,7.0,3.0
Toph," Um, Katara? Are you okay?",7.0,3.0
Katara,Just fine.,7.0,3.0
Toph," Well, what are you doing?",7.0,3.0
Katara,I'm making my own water.,7.0,3.0
Toph," Katara! You're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius!",7.0,3.0
Sokka,This guy is too good! He shoots fire from his brain!,7.0,3.0

Toph,Katara? I need your help.,7.0,3.0
Katara," What is it, Toph?",7.0,3.0
Toph, I need you to write some things down for me. I wanna send a letter to my parents.,7.0,3.0

Avatar Roku, Previously on Avatar ...,8.0,3.0

Katara,"No, it happened to Mom.",8.0,3.0
Katara,"One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home.  Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice.  ""It's so cold and I can't get warm!""  Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone.",8.0,3.0
Sokka, Where'd she go?,8.0,3.0
Katara,"No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.",8.0,3.0

Sokka,Pfft! Nice try.,8.0,3.0
Toph," No, I'm serious. I hear something.",8.0,3.0

Hama," Hello, children.",8.0,3.0
Hama,Sorry to frighten you. My name is Hama.  You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at night.  I have an inn nearby. Why don't you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds?,8.0,3.0
Sokka," Yes, please.",8.0,3.0
Katara,Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn.,8.0,3.0
Hama, Aren't you sweet?  You know you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in.,8.0,3.0

Hama," When the moon turns full, people walk in and they don't come out.  Who wants more tea?",8.0,3.0

Katara,That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages?,8.0,3.0

Aang, Helping people ... that's what I do.,8.0,3.0
Hama,Why don't you take all those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while.,8.0,3.0
Sokka, This is a mysterious little town you have here.,8.0,3.0
Hama, Mysterious town for mysterious children.,8.0,3.0
Sokka,"That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.",8.0,3.0
Katara, That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay.  She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran.,8.0,3.0
Sokka,"But what did she mean by that comment, ""mysterious children""?",8.0,3.0
Katara,"Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?",8.0,3.0
Sokka,I'm gonna take a look around. ,8.0,3.0

Katara," Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!",8.0,3.0
Sokka, I'm not finished yet.  Come on ...,8.0,3.0
Aang,"Okay, that's pretty creepy.",8.0,3.0
Katara," So she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that.  Sokka, you've looked enough.  Hama will be back soon.",8.0,3.0
Sokka,"Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Well then why does she have a locked door up here?",8.0,3.0
Katara, Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!,8.0,3.0
Sokka,"We'll see.  It's empty, except for a little chest.",8.0,3.0
Toph,Maybe it's treasure!,8.0,3.0
Katara," Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room!",8.0,3.0

Hama, I'll tell you what's in the box.,8.0,3.0
Sokka, An old comb?,8.0,3.0
Hama,It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I own from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe.,8.0,3.0
Katara, You're from the Southern Water Tribe?,8.0,3.0
Hama, Just like you.,8.0,3.0
Katara,How did you know?,8.0,3.0
Hama,I heard you talking around your campfire.,8.0,3.0
Sokka,But why didn't you tell us?,8.0,3.0
Hama,"I wanted to surprise you! I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes if you stew them long enough.",8.0,3.0
Aang, Great ...,8.0,3.0
Katara,I knew I felt a bond with you right away.,8.0,3.0
Sokka,"And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right.  But I'm sorry we were sneaking around.",8.0,3.0
Hama,"Apology accepted.  Now, let's get cooking!",8.0,3.0
Aang, I'd steer clear of the sea prunes.,8.0,3.0
Toph,I thought they were ocean kumquats.,8.0,3.0
Aang,Close enough.,8.0,3.0
Hama,Who wants five flavor soup?,8.0,3.0
Katara, You're a waterbender!  I've never met another waterbender from our tribe!,8.0,3.0
Hama, That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one ...,8.0,3.0
Sokka,So how did you end up out here?,8.0,3.0
Hama, I was stolen from my home.,8.0,3.0
Hama, It was over sixty years ago when the raids started.,8.0,3.0
Hama," They came again and again, each time rounding up more of our waterbenders and taking them captive.",8.0,3.0
Hama," We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued.",8.0,3.0
Hama," Finally, I too was captured.",8.0,3.0
Hama, I was led away in chains. The last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe.,8.0,3.0
Hama,They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape.,8.0,3.0
Sokka,How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?,8.0,3.0
Hama,I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore.,8.0,3.0
Katara,We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid.,8.0,3.0
Hama," Oh, you poor things.",8.0,3.0
Katara,I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor. You're a hero.,8.0,3.0
Hama,I never thought I'd meet another Southern waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know so you can carry on the Southern tradition when I'm gone.,8.0,3.0
Katara,"Yes! Yes, of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me.",8.0,3.0
Hama,"Growing up in the South Pole, waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas. But as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go.",8.0,3.0
Katara,"I know! When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do.",8.0,3.0
Hama, That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists.,8.0,3.0
Katara,I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.,8.0,3.0
Hama," That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you could even pull water out of thin air?",8.0,3.0
Hama,"You have got to keep an open mind, Katara.  There's water in places you never think about.",8.0,3.0
Aang,This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.,8.0,3.0
Toph,Maybe the Moon Spirit just turned mean.,8.0,3.0
Sokka," The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!",8.0,3.0
Aang," Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?",8.0,3.0
Villager,Only one man ever saw it and lived and that's Old Man Ding.,8.0,3.0
Toph,Where does Old Man Ding live?,8.0,3.0
Katara,"Wow, these flowers are beautiful.",8.0,3.0
Hama,"They're called fire lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants and all living things, they're filled with water.",8.0,3.0
Katara,I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside.,8.0,3.0
Hama,You can take it even further.,8.0,3.0
Katara,"That was incredible!  It's a shame about the lilies, though.",8.0,3.0
Hama,"They're just flowers. When you're a waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight I'll teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak.",8.0,3.0
Katara, But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.,8.0,3.0
Hama,"Oh, Katara. Two master waterbenders beneath a full moon?  I don't think we have anything to worry about.",8.0,3.0
Aang,Old Man Ding?,8.0,3.0
Ding,"Huh?  Ow, dang blame it! What? Can't you see I'm busy? Got a full moon rising. And why does everyone call me that? I'm not that old!  Well, I'm young at heart.",8.0,3.0
Ding,Not ready to get snapped up by some moon monster yet at least.,8.0,3.0
Sokka, We wanted to ask you about that.,8.0,3.0
Aang,Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?,8.0,3.0
Ding,"Didn't see no spirit, just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain.  I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my own limbs. It just about had me into a cave up there.  And I looked up at the moon for what I thought would be my last glimpse of light.  But then the sun started to rise and I got control of myself again! I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could!",8.0,3.0
Sokka,Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?,8.0,3.0
Toph,Oh no!  I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there!,8.0,3.0
Toph, I can hear them. They're this way!,8.0,3.0
Hama,Can you feel the power the full moon brings?,8.0,3.0
Hama,"For generations it has blessed waterbenders with its glow, allowing us to do incredible things!",8.0,3.0
Hama, I've never felt more alive.,8.0,3.0
Toph,This is the place.,8.0,3.0
Sokka,I can't see anything down there.,8.0,3.0
Toph, That's why you have me. Let's go!,8.0,3.0
Male prisoner #1,We're saved!,8.0,3.0
Aang,I didn't know spirits made prisons like this. Who brought you here?,8.0,3.0
Female prisoner,It was no spirit.,8.0,3.0
Male prisoner #2,It was a witch!,8.0,3.0
Sokka,A witch? What do you mean?,8.0,3.0
Female prisoner," She seems like a normal old woman, but she controls people like some dark puppetmaster!",8.0,3.0
Sokka, Hama!,8.0,3.0
Male prisoner #1,"Yes, the innkeeper!",8.0,3.0
Sokka,I knew there was something creepy about her!,8.0,3.0
Aang,We have to stop Hama!,8.0,3.0
Toph,I'll get these people out of here. You go!,8.0,3.0
Hama,"What I'm about to show you,  I discovered in that wretched Fire Nation prison.",8.0,3.0
Hama," The guards were always very careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air and had us suspended away from the ground. Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend.  Any sign of trouble was met with  cruel  retribution.  And yet each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy.  There had to be something I could do to escape.  Then I realized that where there is life, there is water.  The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing more than skins filled with liquid and I passed years developing the skill that would lead to my escape.  Bloodbending.  Controlling the water in another body,  enforcing your own will over theirs.  Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men.",8.0,3.0
Hama," And during the next full moon, I walked free for the first time in decades.  My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in.  Once you perfect this technique, you can control anything or  anyone.",8.0,3.0
Katara, But ... to reach inside someone and control them?  I don't know if I want that kind of power.,8.0,3.0
Hama," The choice is not yours. The power exists. And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war.  Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture, your mother!",8.0,3.0
Katara, I know.,8.0,3.0
Hama," Then you should understand what I'm talking about! We're the last two waterbenders of the Southern Tribe.  We have to fight these people whenever we can, wherever they are, with any means necessary!",8.0,3.0
Katara, It's you ...  You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!,8.0,3.0
Hama," They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters! They deserve the same! You must carry on my work!",8.0,3.0
Katara, I won't! I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town! ,8.0,3.0
Hama," You should've learned the technique before you turned against me!  It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip! I control every muscle, every vein in your body!",8.0,3.0
Katara, Stop! Please ...,8.0,3.0
Katara," You're not the only one who draws power from the moon!  My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!",8.0,3.0
Hama, Aahhh!,8.0,3.0
Sokka,"We know what you've been doing, Hama!",8.0,3.0
Aang,Give up!  You're outnumbered!,8.0,3.0
Hama,No!  You've outnumbered yourselves.,8.0,3.0
Sokka," Katara, look out!  It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it!",8.0,3.0
Aang,This feels weird!,8.0,3.0
Katara," I'm sorry, Aang!",8.0,3.0
Aang,It's okay!,8.0,3.0
Hama," Don't hurt your friends, Katara! And don't let them hurt each other!",8.0,3.0
Katara, No!,8.0,3.0
Male prisoner #1,You're going to be locked away forever.,8.0,3.0
Hama,"My work is done.  Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender.",8.0,3.0
Sokka, This is it! The official rendezvous point for the invasion force.,9.0,3.0
Toph,How did you pick this place?,9.0,3.0
Sokka,"Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map. It's uninhabited, and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place.",9.0,3.0
Katara,"Nice choice, Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule.",9.0,3.0
Aang, Wait! Four days? The invasion's in  four  days?,9.0,3.0
Sokka, Whatever. That's like four days from now. Let's just calm down and-,9.0,3.0
Katara,"Sokka's got the right idea, Aang. We're here. We're ready. The best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest. ",9.0,3.0
Aang, I guess.,9.0,3.0
Aang," Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord! I'm bringing you down.",9.0,3.0
Ozai,Really?  How do you plan on doing that when you're not even wearing pants?,9.0,3.0
Aang,Oh no!,9.0,3.0
Aang,"It was just a dream, Momo. I still have my pants.  Well, I better keep training.",9.0,3.0
Servant #1,"Fresh fruit, Prince Zuko?",9.0,3.0

Servant #2,Hot towel?,9.0,3.0
Servant #1,"Prince Zuko, is something wrong? You didn't take the palanquin.",9.0,3.0
Zuko,I'm just going to Mai's house. It's not far.,9.0,3.0
Servant #1,"It's not a prince's place to walk anywhere, sir.",9.0,3.0
Katara,Hey. How long have you been up?,9.0,3.0
Aang,A couple hours. I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai.,9.0,3.0
Katara," You know, there is such a thing as over-training.",9.0,3.0
Aang,"You don't get it, do you? My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any firebending. Not even the basics.",9.0,3.0
Sokka,"That's okay, Aang. The eclipse will block off firebending anyway. You don't need to know it.  Plus, it's a stupid element.",9.0,3.0
Aang,"Okay, well I still have to work on everything else. I better spend the whole day training.",9.0,3.0
Aang," Good night, Katara. Good night, Sokka. Good night, Toph. Good night, Appa. Good night, Momo. Good night, Appa and Mo-",9.0,3.0
Toph,  Go to sleep already!  ,9.0,3.0
Aang," Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord.  I'm bringing you down!  And this time, I brought pants.",9.0,3.0
Ozai,"So it seems, but are you prepared for your ... mathematics test?",9.0,3.0
Aang,Math test? Oh no! I forgot all about the math test!,9.0,3.0
Aang,I've gotta be ready.,9.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep.",9.0,3.0
Aang,But I forgot my pants and my math test.,9.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, sleep. Please. For me.",9.0,3.0
Zuko,"Tell me, if you could have anything you want right now, what would it be?",9.0,3.0
Mai,"Hm ... A big fancy fruit tart, with rose petals on top.",9.0,3.0
Zuko,"You know, being a prince and all, I  might  just be able to make that happen.",9.0,3.0
Mai, That would be impressive.,9.0,3.0
Zuko," Do you think you could find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top?",9.0,3.0
Servant,"Excellent choice, sir.",9.0,3.0
Mai,"I guess there's some nice perks that come with being royalty.  Though there's annoying stuff, too. Like that all-day war meeting coming up.",9.0,3.0
Zuko, War meeting? What are you talking about?,9.0,3.0
Mai,"Azula mentioned something. I-I assumed you were going, too.",9.0,3.0
Zuko,I guess I wasn't invited.,9.0,3.0
Ozai,"Wake up, Aang. Wake up, sleepy head!  Rise and shine! You overslept.  You missed the invasion.",9.0,3.0
Aang,"Sokka, get up! I needa know what day it is!",9.0,3.0
Sokka,What? Who's talking?,9.0,3.0
Toph,Relax! It's still two days before the invasion!,9.0,3.0
Aang,"Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises.",9.0,3.0
Sokka,What?,9.0,3.0
Aang,"In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff,  but you were too slow and they got you!",9.0,3.0
Sokka,But that was just a dream. I'm a great climber!,9.0,3.0
Aang, Then climb that cliff! Climb it fast!,9.0,3.0
Sokka,Stupid Avatar! Stupid cliff! Stupid dream! I can climb fast!,9.0,3.0
Aang, Don't drink that!,9.0,3.0
Toph,Why? Is it poisoned?,9.0,3.0
Aang,"In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom!  We died because of your tiny bladder.  And you need to start wearing your hair up. In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and-.",9.0,3.0
Katara," Aang! I know you're just trying to help, but you  really  need to get a grip. You're unraveling.",9.0,3.0
Aang, You're right. I'm losing my mind.,9.0,3.0
Aang,"It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed. I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves.",9.0,3.0
Sokka," Of course you are. That's 'cause you gotta fight the Fire Lord, the baddest man on the planet. And you better win or we're all done for.",9.0,3.0
Katara, Sokka! You're not helping!,9.0,3.0
Sokka, What? It's true. That's the deal. He knows it.,9.0,3.0
Katara,"You know what, I've got just the thing! Get ready to be de-stressified!",9.0,3.0
Katara,These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach  up  .  Reach for the sun.  Feel your chi paths clearing.  Now close your eyes. How are you feeling?,9.0,3.0
Aang, I feel ... really warm.,9.0,3.0
Katara,"Good, good. Go on.",9.0,3.0
Aang,Like there's this warm feeling all around me. This heat.  Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me! And the whole world is being engulfed in flames!,9.0,3.0
Katara,Maybe your stress is the kind you need to  talk  out.,9.0,3.0
Sokka, Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.,9.0,3.0
Aang,You  know  what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.,9.0,3.0
Sokka," Tell me more about this ""Fire Lord"". Why are you so afraid of him?",9.0,3.0
Aang,You said it yourself! He's the baddest man on the planet! I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world!,9.0,3.0
Sokka," Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it? Like we're all trying to save the world from evil.",9.0,3.0
Aang,Okay! But what can I do to feel better?,9.0,3.0
Sokka, Want to try screaming into this pillow?,9.0,3.0
Azula,"Hello, Zuzu. If you've come for a royal hair-combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait.",9.0,3.0
Zuko,"So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh? And apparently I'm not welcome there.",9.0,3.0
Azula,What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there!,9.0,3.0
Zuko,"Oh, yeah?! I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it!",9.0,3.0
Azula,"Oh, Zuko. Don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably just weren't invited because it's so  obvious  you're supposed to be there.",9.0,3.0
Zuko,"Well, were you invited?",9.0,3.0
Azula,Of course! I'm the princess.,9.0,3.0
Zuko,And I'm the prince!,9.0,3.0
Azula,"Exactly, so stop acting like a paranoid child! Just go to the meeting.",9.0,3.0
Zuko,Forget it! I'm not going!,9.0,3.0
Toph,All right! What you need is a good old-fashioned back pounding to relieve your stress.,9.0,3.0
Aang, Pound away.,9.0,3.0
Aang, Ow! Toph ... I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me!,9.0,3.0
Toph,"Sorry. I forgot you had baby skin.  Well, there's one other thing we can try.  Acupuncture!",9.0,3.0
Mai,"Zuko, it's just a dumb meeting. Who cares?",9.0,3.0
Zuko,I don't.,9.0,3.0
Mai,"Well, good. You shouldn't. I mean, why would you even  want  to go? Just think about how things went the last meeting you went to.",9.0,3.0
Zuko, I know.,9.0,3.0
Mai,You know what will make you feel better?  Ordering some servants around. I might be hungry for a whole  tray  of fruit tarts. And maybe a little palanquin ride around town. Double time.,9.0,3.0
Aang,"Thanks for everything, guys.",9.0,3.0
Katara,"So, do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night's sleep?",9.0,3.0
Aang," Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better.  Maybe.",9.0,3.0
Sokka,Then our work here is done.,9.0,3.0
Katara,"What happened, Aang?",9.0,3.0
Aang, It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.,9.0,3.0
Sokka,Looks like it's time for another ...  therapy session.,9.0,3.0
Aang, No. That won't help. Nothing helps. There's only one thing I can do! I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion!,9.0,3.0
Aang,Invasion. All aboard for the invasion.,9.0,3.0
Katara, You don't look so good. You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?,9.0,3.0
Aang,"I told you, I can't go back to sleep.",9.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you.",9.0,3.0
Aang," Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think. And I've realized some big things, Katara.",9.0,3.0
Katara,What big things?,9.0,3.0
Aang,"I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this.  I'm doing it to save the world. But more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love.  I'm doing it for you, Katara.",9.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, what are you saying?",9.0,3.0
Aang,"I'm saying, I love you! ",9.0,3.0
Katara, What are we doing?,9.0,3.0
Aang,"What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby,  you're my forever girl. ",9.0,3.0
Katara,Aang!  I was just saying you should take a nap.,9.0,3.0
Aang," Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream.",9.0,3.0
Katara,What was your dream about?,9.0,3.0
Aang," Uh, living underwater?",9.0,3.0
Katara, Sounds neat!,9.0,3.0
Servant,"Prince Zuko,  everyone's waiting for you.",9.0,3.0
Zuko,What?,9.0,3.0
Servant,"The high admirals, the high generals, the war ministers, and the princess have all arrived. You're the only person missing.",9.0,3.0
Zuko,"So, my dad  wants  me at the meeting?",9.0,3.0
Servant,"The Fire Lord said he would not start until you arrived, sir.",9.0,3.0
Aang,"Put 'em up, Fire Lord!",9.0,3.0
Sokka,Hey! I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's  your  bison.,9.0,3.0
Aang, Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach.,9.0,3.0
Aang,"You think you're untouchable, don't you, Mr. Fire Lord?",9.0,3.0
Momo," Boy, you are really starting to lose it, kid.",9.0,3.0
Aang,"Momo, did you hear something? ",9.0,3.0
Momo," No, but I said something.  You, my friend, are just a few plums short of a fruit pie. ",9.0,3.0
Aang,"That's more like it. I'm so tired that for a second there, I imagined you were talking to me.  Oh, Momo, let me explain. ",9.0,3.0
Katara,Aang? We're all starting to get a little worried about you.,9.0,3.0
Sokka,You've been awake too long.,9.0,3.0
Toph,And you're acting downright weird.,9.0,3.0
Appa,You've got to take care of yourself. You can't go on like this.,9.0,3.0
Aang," Look, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but the stress and the nightmares. They were just too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it.",9.0,3.0
Momo, Yeah! Leave the kid alone!,9.0,3.0
Appa," Hey, who asked  you  ? ",9.0,3.0
Aang,"You guys, come on.",9.0,3.0

Zuko,"During the meeting, I was the perfect prince. The son my father wanted.  But I wasn't me.",9.0,3.0
Aang,"Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds.",9.0,3.0
Toph,Hey! It's real! We spent  hours  working on it.,9.0,3.0
Sokka,We made it for you. A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away. We hope.,9.0,3.0
Aang,"Look! You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't! The invasion's tomorrow!",9.0,3.0
Katara, Aang ...,9.0,3.0

Hakoda,"Don't worry, you'll do great.",10.0,3.0
Sokka,"Good morning everyone. Ahh!  Umm ... so, as you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation! I mean I know you know that because otherwise why else would you be here?  Uh anyway,  the Fire Lord's palace is here . Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh wait, it's here,  and uh, there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us!  And ... um ... I'm sorry let me start at the beginning . Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then we met Suki,  who's a Kyoshi warrior. She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's friend was a crazy old king and ...",10.0,3.0
Katara," Wow, when he says the beginning he means the  beginning  beginning. ",10.0,3.0
Sokka,... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if you look at him in the front row you can see it ...,10.0,3.0
Hakoda," Thank you, Sokka. It's okay why don't you take a break?  Let me just clarify a few points for everyone.  Today, is the day of black sun, and I want to thank you all for your self-sacrifice, and your courage. There are two steps to the invasion, a naval stage, and then a land stage.  To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital, we need to get past our first major obstacle here,  The Great Gates of Azulon. Next, we hit the land, and we hit hard. We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower. Once we do that, it's up to the Royal Palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin.",10.0,3.0
The Boulder,"Excuse me. The Boulder is confused. Isn't the point to invade  during  the eclipse, when the firebenders are powerless?",10.0,3.0
Hakoda,"The eclipse only lasts eight minutes, not enough time for the whole invasion. And the Royal Palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the eclipse's advantage the  most  . When this is finished, the Avatar will have defeated the Fire Lord. We will have control of the Fire Nation capital, and this war will be over!",10.0,3.0

Sokka,"I messed up, Aang.",10.0,3.0
Aang,What?,10.0,3.0
Sokka,The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it. I just fell apart.,10.0,3.0
Aang," Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that.",10.0,3.0
Sokka,"My dad is! He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should.",10.0,3.0
Aang,"Look, your moment of truth isn't gonna be in front of some map; it's gonna be out there on the battlefield.",10.0,3.0
Sokka,"You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win?",10.0,3.0

The Duke, Helmet?,10.0,3.0
Sokka,"Well, I just came up with the idea. The mechanist did all the work.",10.0,3.0
Mechanist,"Now don't sell yourself short, my boy.  It was your idea to use waterbending to make the subs sink and float, brilliant!  Though your original designs were a bit difficult to decipher. Unfortunately there is one problem I couldn't fix.  The subs have a limited air supply. Before we land on the beaches, we'll need to resurface.",10.0,3.0
Ming,"Lunchtime, General Iroh.  And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice.",10.0,3.0

Hakoda," Let's hope our luck holds out.  Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?",11.0,3.0
Katara, Yeah. Is that ... is that  Aang  ?,11.0,3.0
Sokka, What?  Please tell me you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down.,11.0,3.0
Aang, He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned.,11.0,3.0
Sokka, They knew.,11.0,3.0
Aang, It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long-gone; far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse.,11.0,3.0
Sokka, No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker; somewhere he could go and be safe during the siege but still be close enough to lead his nation.,11.0,3.0
Toph,"If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for,  I'm just the girl to find it.",11.0,3.0
Sokka, The mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about ten minutes until the full eclipse. Ten minutes to find the Fire Lord.,11.0,3.0
Aang,We can still do this. We can still win the day.,11.0,3.0
Katara, Wait! If they knew we were coming it could all be a trap.  Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure we all get out of here safely.,11.0,3.0
Hakoda,"Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it.",11.0,3.0
Sokka," What do you think? You're the one that has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you.",11.0,3.0
Aang, I've gotta try.,11.0,3.0
Aang,Do you feel anything down there?,11.0,3.0
Toph, Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano.,11.0,3.0
Sokka,Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?,11.0,3.0
Toph," There is something big, dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano.",11.0,3.0
Sokka, Sounds like a secret bunker to me.,11.0,3.0
Aang, Stay safe. We'll be back soon.,11.0,3.0
Toph, This way! That one's a dead end!,11.0,3.0
Sokka, What would we do without you?,11.0,3.0
Toph, Perish in burning hot magma.,11.0,3.0
Sokka," Yeah, pretty much.",11.0,3.0
Toph,The tunnel continues on the other side and It leads right to the bunker.,11.0,3.0
Sokka,"We'll have to be fast, but careful.",11.0,3.0
Aang,How is that careful?,11.0,3.0
Sokka,"I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky.",11.0,3.0
Sokka,There's no floor. It's just a river of lava.,11.0,3.0
Aang, Climb aboard and hold on tight.,11.0,3.0
Sokka, That's some door!,11.0,3.0
Toph, Not a problem.,11.0,3.0
Sokka, I am so glad we added you to the group!,11.0,3.0
Fire Nation Captain, Retreat! Everyone move to the secondary defensive position! Retreat!,11.0,3.0
Bato, The eclipse is only minutes away. We should be able to make it up to hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time it's finished.,11.0,3.0
Katara, We can wait here if you want.,11.0,3.0
Hakoda, No. I wanna press forward with the others.,11.0,3.0
Qin," The Fire Lord's chamber is that way, down the hall, to the left,  and up the stairs, you can't miss it!",11.0,3.0
Aang, Thanks!,11.0,3.0
Sokka,Only thirty seconds until the total eclipse.,11.0,3.0
Aang,I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.,11.0,3.0
Azula,"So, you are alive after all.  I had a hunch that you survived. But it doesn't matter.  I've known about the invasion for months.",11.0,3.0
Zuko, I'm ready to face you.,11.0,3.0
Ozai,Prince Zuko? What are you doing here?,11.0,3.0
Mechanist,The eclipse is starting!  Put on your eclipse glasses!,11.0,3.0
Ozai,Why are you here?,11.0,3.0
Zuko,I'm here to tell the truth.,11.0,3.0
Ozai, Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse.  This should be interesting.,11.0,3.0
Zuko,"First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.",11.0,3.0
Ozai,Why would she lie to me about that?,11.0,3.0
Zuko,Because the Avatar's not dead. He survived.,11.0,3.0
Ozai, What?,11.0,3.0
Zuko,"In fact, he's probably leading this invasion. He could be on his way here right now.",11.0,3.0
Ozai, Get out! Get out of my sight right now if you know what's good for you!,11.0,3.0
Zuko,That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore.,11.0,3.0
Ozai," You will obey me, or this defiant breath will be your last!",11.0,3.0
Zuko," Think again. I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen.",11.0,3.0
Aang,Where is he? Where's the Fire Lord?,11.0,3.0
Azula, You mean I'm not good enough for you?  You're hurting my feelings.,11.0,3.0
Sokka,"Stop wasting our time and give us the information.  You're powerless right now, so you're in no position to refuse.",11.0,3.0
Toph, And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying.,11.0,3.0
Azula, Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar.  I am a four-hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.,11.0,3.0
Toph," Okay, you're good, I admit it.  But you ought to consider telling the truth anyway!",11.0,3.0
Azula, When I left Ba Sing Se I brought home some souvenirs: Dai Li agents!,11.0,3.0
Bato,"Surround the periphery!  We have to secure the palace by the time the eclipse is over! Otherwise, we'll be in for the fight of our lives.",11.0,3.0
Tyro,Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won't harm you.,11.0,3.0
Fire Nation soldier,"We'll never surrender!  Okay, we surrender. ",11.0,3.0
Hakoda, There it is: the Fire Nation Royal Palace. We've come so far.,11.0,3.0
Katara, It's not over yet.,11.0,3.0
Zuko,"For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.  My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai.  How could you possibly justify a duel with a child?",11.0,3.0
Ozai, It was to teach you respect!,11.0,3.0
Zuko,It was cruel! And it was wrong.,11.0,3.0
Ozai, Then you have learned nothing!,11.0,3.0
Zuko,"No, I've learned everything! And I've had to learn it on my own! Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don't see our greatness. They hate us! And we deserve it!  We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself , we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.",11.0,3.0
Ozai," Your uncle has gotten to you, hasn't he?",11.0,3.0
Zuko,Yes.  He has.,11.0,3.0
Aang, I can't pin her down! She's too quick!,11.0,3.0
Sokka, Wait! Aang! Toph! Stop attacking! Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!,11.0,3.0
Azula, Not true. I'm giving it my all.,11.0,3.0
Toph, You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!,11.0,3.0
Azula," Um, right, I think your friend just said that, genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes. ",11.0,3.0
Toph, I'll roll your whole head!,11.0,3.0
Sokka,She's just baiting you again.,11.0,3.0
Aang,"Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her?",11.0,3.0
Sokka,We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.,11.0,3.0
Azula, It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you.,11.0,3.0
Sokka, Ignore!,11.0,3.0
Azula," So, Sokka's your name, right? My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time.  She was convinced you were going to come rescue her. Of course you never came, and she gave up on you.",11.0,3.0
Azula, Come and get it.,11.0,3.0
Sokka,Where. Is. Suki?!,11.0,3.0
Zuko,"After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness.  He's the one who's been a real father to me.",11.0,3.0
Ozai," Oh, that's just beautiful. And maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure.",11.0,3.0
Zuko,But I've come to an even more important decision.  I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you.,11.0,3.0
Ozai," Really? Since you're a full-blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless. You've got your swords. Why don't you just do it now?",11.0,3.0
Zuko,Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.  Goodbye.,11.0,3.0
Ozai," Coward! You think you're brave enough to face me, but you'll only do it during the eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the sun comes out. Don't you want to know what happened to your mother?",11.0,3.0
Zuko,What happened that night?,11.0,3.0
Ozai,"My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son, and I was going to do it.  Your mother found out and swore she would protect you at any cost.  She knew I wanted the throne and she proposed a plan, a plan in which I would become Fire Lord and your life would be spared.",11.0,3.0
Sokka,Where's Suki? Answer me!,11.0,3.0
Aang," Sokka, she won't talk.",11.0,3.0
Sokka, Where are you keeping her?,11.0,3.0
Ozai,"Your mother did vicious, treasonous things that night. She knew the consequences and accepted them. For her treason, she was banished.",11.0,3.0
Zuko, So she's alive?,11.0,3.0
Ozai, Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason.  Your penalty will be far steeper.,11.0,3.0
Azula,"Oh, sounds like the firebending's back on.",11.0,3.0
Azula, Dad's all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to see you now.,11.0,3.0
Sokka, I fell for it! I used up all our time.,11.0,3.0
Toph,"It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out.",11.0,3.0
Sokka, And now it's too late.,11.0,3.0
Aang,Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over. But I can face the Fire Lord anyway.,11.0,3.0
Sokka, No. I don't think that's a good idea.,11.0,3.0
Aang,But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me.,11.0,3.0
Toph,The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go and help our friends.,11.0,3.0
Aang, I guess you guys are right.,11.0,3.0
Sokka, You'll have another chance. I know you will.,11.0,3.0
Bato,"What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now?",11.0,3.0
Hakoda,"I don't know.  But now that the eclipse is over, I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute.",11.0,3.0
Mechanist," My own invention.  Oh, this is terrible!",11.0,3.0
Katara,They're back!,11.0,3.0
Sokka," It was all a trap! Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move!  We've just got to get to the beach as fast as we can.  If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.",11.0,3.0
Aang,"They've got air power, but so do I!  I'm gonna do what I can to slow them down. ",11.0,3.0
Katara,"Appa, you and I can help too. ",11.0,3.0
Sokka,"Everyone, let's get back to the subs! ",11.0,3.0
Katara,We can't keep them all back! There's too many of them!,11.0,3.0
Aang,Let's join the others! ,11.0,3.0
Zuko,Uncle!  Where is my uncle?,11.0,3.0
Warden Poon," He's gone. He busted himself out. I've never seen anything like it, he was like a one-man army!",11.0,3.0
Sokka,Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs!,11.0,3.0
Katara,Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?,11.0,3.0
Aang, They're heading for the beach ...  They're gonna destroy the submarines!,11.0,3.0
Sokka, How are we all going to escape?,11.0,3.0
Hakoda, We're not.,11.0,3.0
Sokka," Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win.",11.0,3.0
Hakoda,"Yes, with the Avatar we could still win. On another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together.",11.0,3.0
Katara, What?  We can't leave you behind!  We won't leave anyone behind!,11.0,3.0
Hakoda,You're our only chance in the long run. You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe.  It's the only way to keep hope alive.,11.0,3.0
Bato,"The youngest of our group should go with you. The adults will stay behind and surrender. We'll be prisoners, but we'll all survive this battle.",11.0,3.0
Tyro," I've got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons. It's not going to be easy, but we'll get by.",11.0,3.0
Sokka, They're at the beach already!,11.0,3.0
Mechanist," Bye, son. ",11.0,3.0
Teo,"Bye, Dad. I'm really proud of you.",11.0,3.0
The Duke," I'll miss you, Pipsqueak.",11.0,3.0
Pipsqueak," Take care, The Duke.",11.0,3.0
Haru," We'll be back for you, Dad.",11.0,3.0
Tyro,If we don't escape on our own first.,11.0,3.0
Hakoda," We lost today, but we've never been this close.  We tasted victory, and that counts for something.",11.0,3.0
Katara,"We'll miss you, Dad. ",11.0,3.0
Sokka,"Bye, Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise.",11.0,3.0
Aang,Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm gonna make this up to you.,11.0,3.0
Fire Nation soldier,"Should we follow them, princess?",11.0,3.0
Azula,"No, they're too fast. It doesn't matter. They'll be back. ",11.0,3.0
Aang, I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple!,11.0,3.0
Katara,This is humiliating.,12.0,3.0
Sokka, You mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?,12.0,3.0
Katara, Both.,12.0,3.0
Aang," Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired carrying all these people.",12.0,3.0
Teo,I wonder how the rest of the troops are.,12.0,3.0
Haru, They're probably on their way to a prison. Seems like my dad just got out and now he's going back in.,12.0,3.0
The Duke,I miss Pipsqueak.,12.0,3.0
Sokka,I miss not having blisters on my feet.,12.0,3.0
Toph,"Hey, we're here! I can feel it!",12.0,3.0
Katara,Uhhh ... I think your feet need their eyes checked.,12.0,3.0
Aang,"No, she's right. We  are  here!",12.0,3.0
Toph,Wow ... it's amazing!,12.0,3.0
Iroh,What a stunning view.,12.0,3.0
Zuko,The only view I'm interested in seeing is the Avatar in chains.,12.0,3.0
Iroh,"You know, the Avatar hasn't been seen for one hundred years. The chances of finding him here are  very  slim. ",12.0,3.0
Zuko," First we'll check each of the air temples, then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him.",12.0,3.0
Iroh,"Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment. You should take some time to heal and rest.",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"What else would I expect to hear from the  laziest  man in the Fire Nation?  The only way to regain my honor is to find the Avatar, so I will.",12.0,3.0
Teo,It's so different from the Northern Air Temple. I wonder if there are any secret rooms.,12.0,3.0
Haru, Let's go check it out!,12.0,3.0
Katara,You guys go. I think we need to talk about some things.,12.0,3.0
Teo,"I'll race you, Duke.",12.0,3.0
The Duke,"I told you, it's  The  Duke!",12.0,3.0
Aang,Why can't I go?,12.0,3.0
Katara,"We need to decide what we're gonna do now, and since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this.",12.0,3.0
Aang," Fair enough. So, what's the new plan?",12.0,3.0
Sokka,"Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan! You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.",12.0,3.0
Aang," Oh, yeah. That's great, no problem. I'll just do that.",12.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, no one said it's going to be easy.",12.0,3.0
Aang,"Well, it's not even gonna be possible! Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?",12.0,3.0
Katara,We could look for Jeong Jeong!,12.0,3.0
Aang, Yeah ... right.  Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.,12.0,3.0
Toph," Who's ... oh,  never mind. If it's important I'll find out.",12.0,3.0
Aang,"Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we just take a nice tour around the temple? ",12.0,3.0
Toph,What's up with him?,12.0,3.0
Sokka,There's gotta be someone who can teach him firebending.,12.0,3.0
Zuko,"Hello ...  Zuko here, but I guess  you probably already know me, sort of. Uhhh ... so, the thing is I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm  considered to be pretty good at it.  Well, you've seen me, you know, when I was attacking you.  Uhhh ... yeah, I guess  I should apologize for that. But anyway,  I'm good now.  I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad,  but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught  the Avatar firebending.  Well, what's your answer?  Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too. How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side? What would Uncle do?  Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself.  Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means. What would Azula do?  Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends. Your choice.  I guess I'm just not that good at impersonations.",12.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?",12.0,3.0
Aang,What? The wind is too loud in my ears! Check out this loop!,12.0,3.0
Sokka,"Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future!",12.0,3.0
Aang,"Okay, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table! Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber!",12.0,3.0
Toph, I think that'll have to wait.,12.0,3.0
Zuko, Hello ...  Zuko here.,12.0,3.0
Zuko,"Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so, I just thought I'd wait for you here.  I know you must be surprised to see me here.",12.0,3.0
Sokka,"Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"Right. Well, uhhh ... anyway ... what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I, uhhh, I'm good now, and well I think I should join your group, oh, and I can teach firebending to you.  See, I, uhhh ...",12.0,3.0
Toph,You want to  what  now?,12.0,3.0
Katara,"You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?!",12.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, all you've ever done is hunt us down and try to capture Aang!",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"I've done some good things! I mean, I could have stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free. That's something! ",12.0,3.0
Toph,Appa  does seem to like him.,12.0,3.0
Sokka,He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not buying it.,12.0,3.0
Zuko,"I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes in the past.",12.0,3.0
Sokka,Like when you attacked our village?,12.0,3.0
Katara,Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us?,12.0,3.0
Zuko,"Look, I admit I've some awful things. I was wrong to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe. And I never should have sent that Fire Nation assassin after you.  I'm going to try and stop-",12.0,3.0
Sokka," Wait, you sent Combustion Man after us?",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"Well, that's not his name, but-",12.0,3.0
Sokka," Ohhh, sorry. I didn't mean to insult your friend!",12.0,3.0
Zuko, He's not my friend!,12.0,3.0
Toph,That guy locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us all up!,12.0,3.0
Zuko, Why aren't you saying anything? You once said you thought we could be friends. You know I have good in me.,12.0,3.0
Aang,There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done. We'll never let you join us.,12.0,3.0
Katara,You need to get out of here. Now.,12.0,3.0
Zuko,I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore!,12.0,3.0
Sokka,"Either you leave, or we attack.",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner. ",12.0,3.0
Katara,"No, we won't!  Get out of here, and don't come back! And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again!",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"Uggh! I can't believe how stupid I am! I mean, what was I thinking? Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula did that? They would have believed that! Stupid!  Uggh!",12.0,3.0
Katara,Why would he try to fool us like that?,12.0,3.0
Sokka,Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.,12.0,3.0
Katara,This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se. He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.,12.0,3.0
Sokka,"He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes.",12.0,3.0
Katara,"The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price. We can't trust him.",12.0,3.0
Aang,I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?,12.0,3.0
Sokka,And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!,12.0,3.0
Katara,"Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there!",12.0,3.0
Sokka,I could feel it! It's my throatal flap!,12.0,3.0
Aang,"Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out. He risked his life to save me.",12.0,3.0
Katara,No way! I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself!,12.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him.",12.0,3.0
Aang,You're probably right.,12.0,3.0
Katara,And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar!,12.0,3.0
Toph,"Actually, he wasn't lying.",12.0,3.0
Sokka," Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list.",12.0,3.0
Toph,"I'm just saying that, considering his messed-up family and how he was raised, he could have turned out a lot worse.",12.0,3.0
Katara," You're right, Toph! Let's go find him and give him a medal. The ""not as much of a jerk as you could have been"" award!",12.0,3.0
Toph,"All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly.",12.0,3.0
Katara,Easy for you to say! You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates!,12.0,3.0
Sokka,Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island!,12.0,3.0
Aang,Or when he tried to capture me at the Fire Temple!,12.0,3.0
Katara,Why would you even try to defend him?,12.0,3.0
Toph," Because Katara, you're all ignoring one crucial fact:  Aang needs a firebending teacher! We can't think of a single person in the world to do the job! Now one shows up on a silver platter, and you won't even think about it? ",12.0,3.0
Aang,I'm  not  having Zuko as my teacher!,12.0,3.0
Sokka,"You're darn right you're not, buddy.",12.0,3.0
Katara,"Well, I guess that settles that.",12.0,3.0
Toph,Ergh! I'm beginning to wonder who's really the blind one around here! ,12.0,3.0
Zuko,Who's there? Stay back! ,12.0,3.0
Toph,It's me!  Ow! You burned my feet!,12.0,3.0
Zuko,"I'm sorry, it was a mistake! ",12.0,3.0
Toph,Get away from me! ,12.0,3.0
Zuko,Let me help you!  I'm sorry! ,12.0,3.0
Toph,"Get off me, get off me! ",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"I didn't know it was you! Uggh, come back!  Uggh! Why am I so bad at being good?",12.0,3.0
Katara, Has anyone seen Toph?,12.0,3.0
Sokka,I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.,12.0,3.0
Haru,Maybe she's just exploring the air temple. There are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending.,12.0,3.0
Katara,I think we should go look for her.,12.0,3.0
Sokka, Let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.,12.0,3.0
The Duke,We can go check for her!,12.0,3.0
Teo, Yeah! I want to ride that tunnel down to the Hall of Statues again. It will work a lot better now that I fixed my brakes.,12.0,3.0
Katara, Toph! What happened?,12.0,3.0
Toph,My feet got burned!,12.0,3.0
Katara,"Oh no, what happened?",12.0,3.0
Toph,"I just told you, my feet got burned!",12.0,3.0
Katara,"I meant, how.",12.0,3.0
Toph,"Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night. ",12.0,3.0
Aang,You what?,12.0,3.0
Katara,Zuko?,12.0,3.0
Sokka,Uhhh ...!,12.0,3.0
Toph,"I thought he could be helpful to us.  And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out.",12.0,3.0
Sokka,So he attacked you?,12.0,3.0
Toph,"Well, he did, and he didn't. It was sort of an accident.",12.0,3.0
Aang,But he did firebend at you?,12.0,3.0
Toph, Yes.,12.0,3.0
Sokka,"See? You trusted Zuko, and you got burned. Literally!",12.0,3.0
Katara,It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better.  I wish I could have worked on them sooner.,12.0,3.0
Toph,"Yeah, me too.",12.0,3.0
Sokka,Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him.,12.0,3.0
Aang,"I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice.",12.0,3.0
Sokka,"He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him.",12.0,3.0
Toph,Maybe just invite him back here.  He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once.,12.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and  really  make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it! ",12.0,3.0
Katara," You are a master of surprise, Sokka ...",12.0,3.0
Toph,"Ahhh, that's the stuff. Now I know how the rest of you guys feel. Not being able to see with your feet stinks. ",12.0,3.0
Zuko,Stop!  I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore!  The mission is off. I'm ordering you to stop.,12.0,3.0
Zuko,"If you keep attacking, I won't pay you!  All right, I'll pay you double to stop!",12.0,3.0
Toph,He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side!,12.0,3.0
Katara,I can't step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.,12.0,3.0
Sokka," I know how to get an angle on him!  All right buddy, don't fail me now! ",12.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, boomerang!  Awww, boomerang ...",12.0,3.0
Aang,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... thanks, Zuko.",12.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, what about me? I did the boomerang thing.",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world.  I'm sorry for what I did to you.  It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.",12.0,3.0
Aang," I think you  are  supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me. ",12.0,3.0
Zuko, Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.,12.0,3.0
Aang,"Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them.  Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?",12.0,3.0
Toph,Go ahead and let him join.  It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.,12.0,3.0
Aang, Sokka?,12.0,3.0
Sokka," Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then, I'm all for it.",12.0,3.0
Aang, Katara?,12.0,3.0
Katara, I'll go along with whatever you think is right. ,12.0,3.0
Zuko, I won't let you down! I promise!,12.0,3.0
Sokka,"So, here you go, home sweet home, I guess, you know, for now. Unpack? Lunch, soon? Uhhh ... welcome aboard?  Yeah.  Okay, this is really, really weird.",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar. I know it's my destiny to capture him.",12.0,3.0
Iroh," You know Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind, and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.",12.0,3.0
Katara,"You might have everyone else here buying your ... transformation, but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past.  So let me tell you something, right now. You make one step backward,  one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore.  Because I'll make sure your destiny ends ... right then and there. Permanently.",12.0,3.0
Zuko,"I know you're nervous, but remember, firebending in it of itself is  not  something to fear.",13.0,3.0
Aang, Okay. Not something to fear.,13.0,3.0
Zuko," But if you don't respect it,  it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino!",13.0,3.0
Zuko,Now show me what you've got. Any amount of fire you can make.,13.0,3.0
Aang,Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration?,13.0,3.0
Zuko, Good idea. You might wanna take a couple steps back.,13.0,3.0
Zuko, What was that? That was the worst firebending I've ever seen!,13.0,3.0
Aang, I thought it was ... nice. ,13.0,3.0
Zuko, Why is this happening?,13.0,3.0
Aang, Maybe it's the altitude.,13.0,3.0
Zuko," Yeah, could be.",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Just breathe, and ... ",13.0,3.0
Aang, That one kind of felt hot.,13.0,3.0
Zuko, Don't patronize me! You know what it's supposed to look like!,13.0,3.0
Aang,"Sorry, Sifu Hotman.",13.0,3.0
Zuko, And stop calling me that!,13.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, jerks! Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending?",13.0,3.0
Zuko, Get out of here! ,13.0,3.0
Sokka,"Okay, take it easy.  I was just kiddin' around.  Jerkbending, still got it. ",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Listen everybody, I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff. ",13.0,3.0
Toph," Don't look at me,  I didn't touch your stuff.",13.0,3.0
Zuko,I'm talking about my firebending. It's gone. ,13.0,3.0
Katara,"I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago.",13.0,3.0
Zuko," Well, it's not lost. It's just ... weaker for some reason.",13.0,3.0
Katara, Maybe you're not as good as you think you are.,13.0,3.0
Toph, Ouch. ,13.0,3.0
Zuko, I bet it's because I changed sides.,13.0,3.0
Katara, That's ridiculous. ,13.0,3.0
Aang,I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to.,13.0,3.0
Sokka," Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough.",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Okay, cut it out!  Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way.",13.0,3.0
Toph, You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source. I recommend the original source. ,13.0,3.0
Sokka, How's he supposed to do that‌? By jumping into a volcano‌?,13.0,3.0
Toph,No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is.,13.0,3.0
Sokka," So, is it jumping into a volcano?",13.0,3.0
Toph,"I don't know.  For earthbending, the original benders were badgermoles.",13.0,3.0
Toph," One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave.",13.0,3.0
Toph,That's where I met them.,13.0,3.0
Toph,"They were blind, just like me.  So we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending,  not just as a martial art, but as an extension of my senses.  For them, the original earthbenders,  it wasn't just about fighting. It was their way of interacting with the world. ",13.0,3.0
Aang,"That's amazing, Toph!",13.0,3.0
Aang," I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison.  Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy.",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct.",13.0,3.0
Aang," What do you mean‌? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of dragons when I was a kid.",13.0,3.0
Zuko," Well, they aren't around anymore, okay?",13.0,3.0
Aang,"Okay, okay.  I'm sorry.",13.0,3.0
Zuko,But maybe there's another way.  The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors.,13.0,3.0
Aang," Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid.",13.0,3.0
Zuko," No, they died off thousands of years ago. But their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now.  Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins.",13.0,3.0
Aang,"It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.",13.0,3.0
Sokka,"So, what?  Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing  where they stood a thousand years ago?",13.0,3.0
Zuko," More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend,  or the Avatar has to find a new teacher. ",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster.",13.0,3.0
Aang," Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude.",13.0,3.0
Zuko, I can't believe this. ,13.0,3.0
Aang," Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.",13.0,3.0
Aang and Zuko,Whoa!,13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Even though these buildings are ancient, there's something eerily familiar about them.  I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these.",13.0,3.0
Aang," Okay. We've learned something about architecture.  Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too. The past can be a great teacher.",13.0,3.0
Aang," Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.",13.0,3.0
Zuko, I can't believe it.  This booby trap must be centuries old and it still works.,13.0,3.0
Aang,There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.,13.0,3.0
Zuko," Where's that up-beat attitude you were talkin' about?  Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting.",13.0,3.0
Aang,"Look, this seems promising.  Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending.",13.0,3.0
Zuko, They look pretty angry to me.,13.0,3.0
Aang, I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors.,13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Well, they had a funny way of showing it.",13.0,3.0
Aang,"Zuko,  something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years.  Something you're not telling me.",13.0,3.0
Zuko, My great-grandfather Sozin happened.,13.0,3.0
Zuko,"He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory. There were the ultimate firebenders.  And if you could conquer one, your firebending talents would become legendary and you'd earn the honorary title, Dragon.  The last great dragon was conquered long before I was born,  by my uncle.",13.0,3.0
Aang," But I thought your uncle was ... I don't know, good?",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"He had a complicated past.  Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on.",13.0,3.0
Aang,It's locked up!,13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Wait.  It's a celestial calendar.  Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples.  I bet that sunstone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle.  On the solstice.",13.0,3.0
Aang, Monkeyfeathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.,13.0,3.0
Zuko," No, we can't.  But we might be able to speed time up.  Let's see if we can outsmart the sunstone.",13.0,3.0
Aang,Nothing's happening.,13.0,3.0
Zuko, Come on ...,13.0,3.0
Aang," You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you.  You're pretty smart.",13.0,3.0
Zuko,Relax. They're just statues.,13.0,3.0
Aang,It says this is something called the Dancing Dragon.,13.0,3.0
Aang,"Zuko, get over here! I want you to dance with me!",13.0,3.0
Zuko, What?,13.0,3.0
Aang,Just do it.,13.0,3.0
Aang,Let's follow the steps of the statues.  Don't you see? These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson.  I think this is some kind of Sun Warrior firebending form.,13.0,3.0
Zuko,This better teach us some really good firebending.,13.0,3.0
Aang,"Hurray!  Wait, what exactly is that?",13.0,3.0
Zuko, It's some kind of mystical gemstone.,13.0,3.0
Aang," Well, don't touch it! ",13.0,3.0
Zuko,Why not?,13.0,3.0
Aang,Remember what happened out there with those spikes?  I'm just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals.,13.0,3.0
Zuko,It feels almost alive.,13.0,3.0
Aang," Oh no, it's another trap!",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Ugh, I can't pull free. It's like some kind of glue.",13.0,3.0
Aang," I can't move! Zuko, do something!",13.0,3.0
Zuko,Me? I can't move either!,13.0,3.0
Aang,It stopped.,13.0,3.0
Zuko,"At least we have air. Maybe if we stay calm, we can figure a way out of this.",13.0,3.0
Aang,"You  had  to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?",13.0,3.0
Zuko," At least I made something happen. If it were up to you, we'd never have made it past the courtyard.",13.0,3.0
Aang, Help!,13.0,3.0
Zuko,Who are you yelling to? Nobody's lived here for centuries.,13.0,3.0
Aang,"Well, what do you think we should do?",13.0,3.0
Zuko,Think about our place in the universe‌?,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief, Who is down there?,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," For trying to take our sunstone, you must be severely punished!",13.0,3.0
Zuko, We didn't come here to take your sunstone. We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.,13.0,3.0
Ham Ghao,"Yeah, right. They are obviously thieves,  here to steal Sun Warrior treasures.",13.0,3.0
Aang,"Please, I don't normally play this card, but ...  I'm the Avatar.  Just hear us out.",13.0,3.0
Zuko," My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.  O-or at least I used to be.  I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage. But now I want to learn the true way,  the original way. When we came here, I never imagined  the Sun Warrior's civilization was secretly alive. I am truly humbled to be in your presence.  Please, teach us.",13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," If you wish to learn the ways of the Sun, you must learn them from the masters, Ran and Shaw.",13.0,3.0
Aang, Ran and Shaw? There are two of them?,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," When you present yourself to them, they will examine you.  They'll read your hearts, your souls, and your ancestry.  If they deem you worthy, they'll teach you.  If they don't, you'll be destroyed on the spot.",13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief,"If you're going to see the masters,  you must bring them a piece of the Eternal Flame.  This fire is the very first one.  It was given to man by the dragons.  We have kept it going for thousands of years.",13.0,3.0
Zuko, I don't believe it.,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," You will each take a piece of it to the masters, to show your commitment to the sacred art of firebending.",13.0,3.0
Aang," Umm, Mister Sun Chief Sir‌, yeah, I'm not a firebender yet.  Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me?",13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," No.  This ritual illustrates  the essence of Sun Warrior philosophy.  You must maintain a constant heat. The flame will go out if you make it too small.  Make it too big, and you might lose control.",13.0,3.0
Aang,"I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.  It's like a little heartbeat.",13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," Fire is life,  not just destruction. You will take your flames up there.  The cave of the masters is beneath that rock.",13.0,3.0
Zuko,Hurry up.,13.0,3.0
Aang,"I can't.  If I walk too fast, my flame will go out. ",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Your flame's  gonna go out  because it's too small. You're too timid, give it more juice.",13.0,3.0
Aang, But what if I can't control it?,13.0,3.0
Zuko, You can do it. I know you can.  You're a talented kid.,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief, Facing the judgment of the firebending masters will be very dangerous for you. Your ancestors  are directly responsible for the dragons' disappearance.  The masters might not be so happy to see you.,13.0,3.0
Ham Ghao, I know  I  wouldn't be.,13.0,3.0
Aang,But once they find out I'm the Avatar ...,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," Have you forgotten that you vanished, allowing the Fire Nation to wreak havoc on the world‌?  The decline of the dragons is your burden, too. ",13.0,3.0
Aang, We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we'd hoped. ,13.0,3.0
Zuko,"No, we're seeing this through to the end. We're gonna meet these masters and find out  what's so great about them.",13.0,3.0
Aang," What if they judge us, and attack us?",13.0,3.0
Zuko," Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar.  I think we could take these guys in a fight, whoever they are. ",13.0,3.0
Zuko,Bring 'em out!,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief, Chanters!,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior," Those who wish to meet the masters, Ran and Shaw, will now present their fire.",13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief,Sound the call!,13.0,3.0
Aang,"What's happening‌?  Zuko, my fire went out.",13.0,3.0
Zuko, What do you want me to do‌?,13.0,3.0
Aang,Give me some of yours. ,13.0,3.0
Zuko," No, just make your own.",13.0,3.0
Aang, I can't. ,13.0,3.0
Zuko, Get some from those warriors.  Hurry!  Stop cheating off me!,13.0,3.0
Aang, Quit being stingy!,13.0,3.0
Aang,Uh oh.,13.0,3.0
Zuko, These are the masters.,13.0,3.0
Aang, Still think we can take 'em?,13.0,3.0
Zuko,Sshh. I never said that.,13.0,3.0
Ham Ghao,"Oh, here it comes.  Any moment now. Dinner for the masters.",13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," Quiet, Ham Ghao!",13.0,3.0
Ham Ghao,What?  Everyone's thinking it.,13.0,3.0
Aang," Zuko, I think we're supposed to do the Dragon Dance with them.",13.0,3.0
Zuko, What‌? What about this situation makes you think they want us to dance‌?,13.0,3.0
Aang,"Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it.",13.0,3.0
Zuko, Fine.,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief, Judgment time.,13.0,3.0
Aang,Wow.,13.0,3.0
Zuko, I understand.,13.0,3.0
Zuko," Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined.",13.0,3.0
Aang, Like firebending harmony.,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief,"Yes. They judged you, and gave you visions of the meaning of firebending. ",13.0,3.0
Zuko, I can't believe there are still living dragons. My uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it.,13.0,3.0
Aang, So your uncle lied.,13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," Actually, it wasn't a total lie. Iroh was the last outsider to face the masters.  They deemed him worthy and passed the secret onto him as well.",13.0,3.0
Zuko," He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them.",13.0,3.0
Aang," All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life. ",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"Yeah. It's like the Sun,  but inside of you. Do you guys realize this?",13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," Well, our civilization is called the Sun Warriors ... so yeah.",13.0,3.0
Zuko,"That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many years, hunting you  was my drive ... it was my purpose.  So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire. But now, I have a new drive.  I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world.",13.0,3.0
Sun Warrior chief," Now that you have learned the secrets, and you know about our tribe's existence,  we have no choice but to imprison you here forever.  Just kidding.  But seriously, don't tell anyone!",13.0,3.0
Aang," With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable.",13.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there.",13.0,3.0
Zuko,It's not a dance. It's a firebending form.,13.0,3.0
Sokka, We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord.,13.0,3.0
Zuko, It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!,13.0,3.0
Katara,"Oh, yeah‌? What's your little form called‌?",13.0,3.0
Zuko, The Dancing Dragon.,13.0,3.0
Zuko," No one can make tea like Uncle , but hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?",14.0,3.0
Katara,Sure. ,14.0,3.0
Aang,I like jokes.,14.0,3.0
Toph,Bring it!,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Okay.  Well, I can't remember how it starts, but the punch line  is ""Leaf me alone, I'm bushed!""  Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.",14.0,3.0
Katara,Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing.,14.0,3.0
Toph,It's nice to get a chance to relax a little. It hardly ever happens.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second? ",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"So, what's up? ",14.0,3.0
Sokka,"If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?",14.0,3.0
Zuko,What do you mean? Who was captured?,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where they might be.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,I can't tell you.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,What? Why not?,14.0,3.0
Zuko,Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse. ,14.0,3.0
Sokka,It's my dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him through.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"It's not good, Sokka.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,Please.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"My guess is, they were taken to the Boiling Rock.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,What's that?,14.0,3.0
Zuko,The highest security prison in the Fire Nation.  It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake. It's inescapable.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"So, where is this place?",14.0,3.0
Zuko,Why do you need to know? What are you planning?,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"Nothing.  Boy, you're so paranoid.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"Thanks, Zuko.  Just knowing makes me feel better.",14.0,3.0
Zuko," Yeah, I'm sure it does.",14.0,3.0
Sokka, Shhh.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Not up to anything, huh?",14.0,3.0
Sokka," Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now?",14.0,3.0
Zuko,I'm never happy.,14.0,3.0
Sokka," Look, I  have  to do this. The invasion plan was  my  idea, it was  my  decision to stay when things were going wrong.  It's  my  mistake, and it's  my  job to fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko. ",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,No. I have to do this alone.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares.  We'll take my war balloon. ",14.0,3.0
Toph,What does it say?,14.0,3.0
Katara,"""Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko.""  One more thing. ""Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko.""",14.0,3.0
Aang," Nobody else has homework.  One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ...",14.0,3.0
Sokka,Pretty clouds.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,Yeah ... fluffy.  What?,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,No kidding.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yep, a balloon ... but for war.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war. ",14.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, it seems to run in the family.",14.0,3.0
Zuko," Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,"I know, I know, you've changed.",14.0,3.0
Zuko, I meant my uncle. He was more of a father to me. And I really let him down.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's hard.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,It wasn't that hard.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Well, I did have a girlfriend. Mai.",14.0,3.0
Sokka, That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?,14.0,3.0
Zuko, Yeah. Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,My first girlfriend turned into the moon.,14.0,3.0
Zuko," That's rough, buddy.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"There it is!  There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through it without being caught.",14.0,3.0
Zuko, We're going down! The balloon's not working anymore! ,14.0,3.0
Sokka,The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly!,14.0,3.0
Zuko, So what are we supposed to do?,14.0,3.0
Sokka,I don't know! Crash-landing?,14.0,3.0
Zuko, How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?,14.0,3.0
Sokka,We'll figure something out! I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?,14.0,3.0
Sokka, My dad might be here! I had to come and see!,14.0,3.0
Zuko,Uncle always said I never thought things through. But this ... this is just crazy!,14.0,3.0
Sokka," Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place! And for the record, I  always  think things through! But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear. So there. ",14.0,3.0
Zuko,What are you doing?,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,I hope you know what you're doing.  There's no turning back now.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,I hope these disguises work.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible.,14.0,3.0
Male guard,Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard. Come on.,14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,I didn't do anything! I'm going back to my cell.,14.0,3.0
Bully guard," Stop right there, Chit Sang.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,We can't blow our cover.,14.0,3.0
Bully guard,I've had it with your unruly behavior!,14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,What did I do?,14.0,3.0
Bully guard,He wants to know what he did.  Isn't that cute? ,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Uh, very cute, sir.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,Super cute.,14.0,3.0
Bully guard," You didn't bow down when I walked by, Chit Sang!",14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,What? That's not a prison rule.,14.0,3.0
Bully guard,Do it!,14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,Make me.,14.0,3.0
Bully guard,"Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited. You're going in the cooler.  You! Help me take him in.",14.0,3.0
Sokka, Meet back here in an hour. ,14.0,3.0
Bully guard,The warden will deal with you soon.  Can you believe this guy?,14.0,3.0
Sokka, Prisoners! Am I right?,14.0,3.0
Bully guard,Ugh. Tell me about it.,14.0,3.0
Male guard,"Hey, new guy! I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times, but this is the lounge. Relax.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head.",14.0,3.0
Female guard,"Give it a week, he'll loosen up.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?,14.0,3.0
Female guard," No, you can't date the female guards.",14.0,3.0
Male guard,"Trust me, you don't want to. ",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals, right?  So what about war prisoners?",14.0,3.0
Sokka,It sure looks cold in there.,14.0,3.0
Bully guard,That's why we call it the cooler. He won't be firebending there.  It's the warden!  Look alive!,14.0,3.0
Warden," So Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better.",14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,I wasn't trying to escape.,14.0,3.0
Bully guard,He's lying! I saw it with my own eyes. ,14.0,3.0
Warden,"No one has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner jump in the Boiling Lake myself than let that record fall. Don't forget it. Now go back to your shivering.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Hey there, fellow guard, how goes it?",14.0,3.0
Sokka, Zuko?,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Shhh! Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no Water Tribe prisoners.  I'm afraid your father's not here.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,"What? Are you sure, did you double-check?",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Yeah, I'm sure.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,No. No! ,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"I'm really sorry, Sokka.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,So we came all this way for nothing? I failed ... again.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Ah,  what would Uncle say?  Sometimes, clouds have two sides,  a dark and light, and a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich!  So ... when life seems hard ...  take a bite out of the silver sandwich!",14.0,3.0
Sokka,Maybe we haven't failed after all!,14.0,3.0
Zuko,That's the spirit!  I can't believe that worked.  I didn't even know what I was saying.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"No, what you said made no sense at all. But look ...  It's Suki!",14.0,3.0
Guard," Prisoners,  back in your cells!",14.0,3.0
Suki, What is it? Did I do something wrong?,14.0,3.0
Sokka, You mean you don't recognize me?,14.0,3.0
Suki, You people all look the same to me.,14.0,3.0
Sokka, Oh? Then maybe you'll recognize this.,14.0,3.0
Suki,Sokka!  It's you!,14.0,3.0
Sokka," The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?",14.0,3.0
Suki,No. I don't know where they are. They locked me in here because I'm the leader.,14.0,3.0
Sokka," Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out.",14.0,3.0
Suki, I'm so glad  to see you Sokka.  I knew you'd come.,14.0,3.0
Female guard,Excuse me.  I need to get into that cell.,14.0,3.0
Zuko," No, you can't go in there!  The lights are out.  The prisoner could sneak up on you.",14.0,3.0
Female guard," Step aside, fool.  Hey, hey, what are you doing?",14.0,3.0
Female guard," Guard, help!  I think he's an impostor!  Arrest him!",14.0,3.0
Female guard,Get him off me and arrest him!,14.0,3.0
Sokka," You're under arrest!  Don't worry, I'll figure it out.",14.0,3.0
Warden,"Well, well, well. I never thought I'd find you in here,  Prince Zuko.",14.0,3.0
Zuko, How did you know who I am?,14.0,3.0
Warden,How could I not? You broke my niece's heart.,14.0,3.0
Zuko, You're Mai's uncle? I never meant to hurt her.,14.0,3.0
Warden,"Quiet! You're my special prisoner now. And you'd best behave. If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down, why they'd tear you to shreds.",14.0,3.0
Zuko, So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my father to come collect a reward?,14.0,3.0
Warden,"Oh, in due time, believe me, I intend to collect. ",14.0,3.0
Sokka,"Oh, good, you guys have met.",14.0,3.0
Suki,"Actually, we met a long time ago.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,We did?,14.0,3.0
Suki," Yeah, you kind of burned down my village.",14.0,3.0
Zuko," Oh, sorry about that. Nice to see you again.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,"So, listen, I think I have an escape plan. I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?",14.0,3.0
Zuko,Yeah ...,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right?",14.0,3.0
Suki,"Just get to the point, Sokka.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water.,14.0,3.0
Zuko, The cooler as a boat? Are you sure?,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"I'm telling you, it'll work.  I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point.  I already tested it out. We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound, no one will notice.  And bing-bang-boom, we're home free.",14.0,3.0
Suki,But how are you going to get the cooler out?,14.0,3.0
Chit Sang," Yeah, how are you going to get the cooler out? ",14.0,3.0
Sokka, What? We didn't ... w-we didn't say that.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Yeah, you heard wrong.",14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,"I heard you hatching an escape plan, and I want in.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,There's nothing to get in on.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg?",14.0,3.0
Chit Sang," Okay, well, I come with you or the warden  hears about this egg, too.",14.0,3.0
Suki, I guess we have no choice.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"Okay, you're in.  Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside.",14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,"Oh, I can get you inside.",14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,"Hey! What are you, stupid? Watch where you're going! ",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Hey, you watch who you're shoving! ",14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,I think you mean  whom  I'm shoving!,14.0,3.0
Sokka, I need backup over here!,14.0,3.0
Male guard,No firebending!  Into the cooler!,14.0,3.0
Sokka,I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.,14.0,3.0
Zuko," Yes, I have ... completely. ",14.0,3.0
Sokka, I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,Someone's coming! ,14.0,3.0
Male guard,"Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn.",14.0,3.0
Female guard,Anybody interesting?,14.0,3.0
Male guard,"Nah, just the usual. Some robbers, a couple traitors, some war prisoners,  though I did hear there might be a pirate.",14.0,3.0
Female guard,No fooling!,14.0,3.0
Zuko,War prisoners. It could be your father.,14.0,3.0
Sokka,I know.,14.0,3.0
Zuko,"Well, what should we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?",14.0,3.0
Sokka,"I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"It's your call, Sokka.",14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,"Took you guys long enough.  This here's my girl and my best buddy, they're coming too.",14.0,3.0
Sokka,Fine. Everybody in the cooler. Let's go. ,14.0,3.0
Zuko,Are you sure you wanna go? You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your dad is your chance.,14.0,3.0
Suki, Your dad?,14.0,3.0
Sokka," If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.",14.0,3.0
Sokka, That supposed to make me feel better?,14.0,3.0
Zuko, Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again ...,14.0,3.0
Sokka,"Seriously, not helping.",14.0,3.0
Zuko, You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you  might  fail.,14.0,3.0
Chit Sang," Hey, if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on?",14.0,3.0
Sokka,No. I'm staying. You guys go.  You've been here long enough.,14.0,3.0
Suki,"I'm not leaving without you, Sokka.",14.0,3.0
Zuko,"I'm staying, too.",14.0,3.0
Chit Sang,"Not me, I'm out. Let's roll, baby. ",14.0,3.0
Sokka,We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.,14.0,3.0

Warden," Welcome to the Boiling Rock. I'm sure you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island. Well, I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true, as long as you do everything I say.  Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you.",15.0,3.0
Hakoda, No.,15.0,3.0
Warden,Oh? You'd rather look at my shoes?  Then take a look!,15.0,3.0
Warden,"I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong-willed.  But don't worry, we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye!",15.0,3.0
Warden," See, isn't that better?  You will all do as I say or pay the price. You will all-",15.0,3.0

Warden,Are you still comfortable?,15.0,3.0
Chit Sang,No.,15.0,3.0
Warden,I know you and your cronies are not smart enough to come up with that little escape plan. So you're gonna tell me ...  who is?,15.0,3.0
Sokka, So where's Bato?  Where's everyone else from the invasion?,15.0,3.0
Hakoda,"The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here.  But before I left, I met some young women who said they knew you. The ... Oshinama Fighters?",15.0,3.0

Hakoda,That's right.,15.0,3.0

Hakoda, Sounds like a major problem.,15.0,3.0
Sokka,"Actually, he's on our side now.  I know. I had the same reaction. After all he's done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help. ",15.0,3.0
Hakoda,"So, do you have a plan?",15.0,3.0
Sokka," We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it.  I dunno if there's another way off this island.",15.0,3.0

Sokka,I just got done talking to my dad. We came up with an escape plan together.,15.0,3.0
Male guard, What are you doing here?,15.0,3.0
Sokka, I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!,15.0,3.0
Male guard,"Well, you'll have to do that later. He's coming with us.",15.0,3.0
Sokka, Why?,15.0,3.0
Female guard," Because we have orders straight from the warden, that's why!",15.0,3.0

Warden, Have you had enough time to think about what I asked?,15.0,3.0
Chit Sang,Yes.,15.0,3.0
Warden, And?,15.0,3.0
Chit Sang,You're right. There was another person involved in the escape plan.,15.0,3.0
Warden, Who?,15.0,3.0
Chit Sang,It's a guy who's disguised like a prison guard. Only he's not a prison guard. He's the mastermind. He came up with the plan.,15.0,3.0
Zuko,How did you know I was here?,15.0,3.0
Mai,Because I know you so well.,15.0,3.0
Zuko,"But, how-",15.0,3.0
Mai,"The warden's my uncle, you idiot.  The truth is, I guess I don't know you. All I get is a letter? You could have least looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart.",15.0,3.0
Zuko,I didn't mean to -,15.0,3.0
Mai,"You didn't mean to?  ""Dear Mai, I'm sorry you that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving.""",15.0,3.0

Zuko,That's not how I see it.,15.0,3.0
Suki,"Sokka, what's going on?",15.0,3.0
Sokka, I don't have much time. If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up.  I just talked to my dad.,15.0,3.0
Suki,That's great.,15.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola.",15.0,3.0
Suki,What?,15.0,3.0
Sokka,My dad and I came up with the plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola  and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.,15.0,3.0
Suki, We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards.,15.0,3.0
Sokka,My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.,15.0,3.0
Suki,"Okay, let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive.",15.0,3.0
Sokka,Not if the warden  is  the captive.  I have to go.  I'll find you before we start the riot. ,15.0,3.0

Sokka,Why?,15.0,3.0
Male guard,"I don't know, I didn't ask.",15.0,3.0
Sokka,Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow? ,15.0,3.0
Male guard,He wants to see you ... now. ,15.0,3.0
Warden,Put him in the line-up.,15.0,3.0

Bully guard, I am not!  He's lying!  He's a liar!,15.0,3.0
Bully guard,I'm telling you ... it wasn't me!,15.0,3.0
Warden,Save your breath! I know you were working together.  You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan.,15.0,3.0
Bully guard,That was just a coincidence!,15.0,3.0
Bodyguard #2,"Sir, there's someone to see you.",15.0,3.0
Warden, Who told you to interrupt me?,15.0,3.0
Azula,I  did.,15.0,3.0
Warden, Princess Azula.  Ah ... It is an honor to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison.  I didn't realize you were coming.,15.0,3.0
Azula, Who is this?,15.0,3.0
Warden, He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt.,15.0,3.0
Bully guard, It wasn't me!,15.0,3.0
Warden," Quiet, you!",15.0,3.0
Azula, You're wasting your time. That's not one of them. ,15.0,3.0
Warden,How do you know?,15.0,3.0
Azula, Because I'm a people person. ,15.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard.",15.0,3.0
Door guard,But we're in the middle of a lockdown.,15.0,3.0
Sokka,"Oh, okay, I'll just go tell the warden you said that.  I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority.  What's your name again?",15.0,3.0
Door guard, Wait! Don't tell the warden. I'm just a little confused.,15.0,3.0
Sokka,"Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says. ",15.0,3.0
Door guard,Yeah ... you're right. We're letting them out!,15.0,3.0
Sokka,This is it! We have to start a riot.,15.0,3.0
Suki,Okay. But how do we do that?,15.0,3.0
Hakoda, I'll show you. ,15.0,3.0
Tough prisoner,Hey! What'd you do that for? That hurt my feelings.,15.0,3.0
Hakoda,Aren't you mad at me?,15.0,3.0
Tough prisoner,"Uh, well, normally I would be, but I've been learning to control my anger.",15.0,3.0
Sokka,This isn't working.,15.0,3.0
Chit Sang,"Hey you! You're lucky I didn't rat you out,  but my generosity comes with a price. I know you're planning another escape attempt, and I want in.",15.0,3.0
Sokka," Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot.  You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you?",15.0,3.0
Chit Sang,A prison riot? Please.  Hey!  Riot!,15.0,3.0
Hakoda, Impressive.,15.0,3.0
Tough prisoner,Forget about controlling my anger ...  let's riot! ,15.0,3.0
Warden,Who let these prisoners into the yard?  This is supposed to be a lockdown!,15.0,3.0
Male guard #2,"Ma'am, there's a riot going on! I'm here to protect you!",15.0,3.0
Mai,I don't need any protection.,15.0,3.0

Mai,Get off of me! ,15.0,3.0
Sokka,"Zuko! Good, we're all here. Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas!",15.0,3.0
Zuko,And how do we do that?,15.0,3.0
Sokka,I'm not sure.,15.0,3.0
Zuko, I thought you thought this through!,15.0,3.0
Sokka,I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!,15.0,3.0
Zuko,"Maybe not everything, but this is kind of important! ",15.0,3.0
Chit Sang,"Hey, uh, fellas. I think your girlfriend's taking care of it.",15.0,3.0

Suki,Everyone in!,15.0,3.0
Sokka,What are you doing?,15.0,3.0
Zuko,I'm making it so they can't stop us.,15.0,3.0

Suki,We're on our way!,15.0,3.0
Hakoda,Wait! Who's that?,15.0,3.0
Zuko,That's a problem. It's my sister and her friend.,15.0,3.0

Zuko, It's Mai!,15.0,3.0
Azula, What is she doing?,15.0,3.0
Hakoda,"Sorry, warden. Your record is officially  broken  . ",15.0,3.0
Suki,"Well, we made it out. Now what?",15.0,3.0
Sokka,"Zuko, what are you doing?",15.0,3.0
Zuko,My sister was on that island.,15.0,3.0
Sokka,"Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop!",15.0,3.0
Zuko,What I mean is she must have come here somehow.  There!  That's our way out of here!,15.0,3.0
Azula,"Leave us alone.  I never expected this from you.  The thing I don't understand is ""Why?"". Why would you do it? You know the consequences.",15.0,3.0
Mai,I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated. I love Zuko more than I fear you.,15.0,3.0
Azula," No,  you  miscalculated! You should have feared me more!",15.0,3.0

Zuko,It kind of got destroyed.,15.0,3.0
Aang,Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.,15.0,3.0
Toph,Did you at least get some good meat?,15.0,3.0
Sokka,I did. The best meat of all. The meat of friendship and fatherhood.,15.0,3.0
Chit Sang," I'm new. What's up, everybody?",15.0,3.0
Katara, Dad? ,15.0,3.0
Hakoda,"Hi, Katara. ",15.0,3.0
Katara,How are you here? What is going on? Where did you go?,15.0,3.0
Sokka,We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.,15.0,3.0
Toph,Seriously? You guys didn't find  any  meat?,15.0,3.0
Zuko, Watch out!,16.0,3.0
Katara, What are you doing?,16.0,3.0

Zuko,I'll take that as a thank you. ,16.0,3.0
Toph, Come on! We can get out through here!,16.0,3.0
Aang, What are you doing?,16.0,3.0

Azula, You mean it's not obvious yet? I am about to celebrate becoming an only child!,16.0,3.0
Aang,I can't get him to go in there! Appa hates tunnels!,16.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here.",16.0,3.0
Aang,We'll have to find a way!,16.0,3.0
Sokka,We need to split up.  Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.,16.0,3.0
Katara, No!  The Fire Nation can't separate our family again!,16.0,3.0
Hakoda,It'll be okay. It's not forever.,16.0,3.0
Toph,I can clear that away and we can fly out through there!,16.0,3.0
Suki,"Um, there's an awful lot of fire in that general direction ...",16.0,3.0
Aang,We'll get through. Let's go.,16.0,3.0
Zuko,She's ... not gonna make it ...  Of course she did.,16.0,3.0
Aang,"Wow, camping ... it really seems like old times again, doesn't it?",16.0,3.0
Zuko," If you really want it to feel like old times, I could, uh ... chase you around a while and try to capture you. ",16.0,3.0
Katara," Ha, ha.",16.0,3.0
Sokka," To Zuko! Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero?",16.0,3.0
Team Avatar, Hear! Hear! ,16.0,3.0
Zuko, I'm touched.  I don't deserve this.,16.0,3.0
Katara," Yeah, no kidding. ",16.0,3.0
Sokka,What's with her?,16.0,3.0
Zuko,I wish I knew. ,16.0,3.0
Sokka, What's with him?,16.0,3.0
Zuko,This isn't fair! Everyone else seems to trust me now! What is it with you?,16.0,3.0
Katara," Oh, everyone trusts you now! I was the first person to trust you!  Remember, back in Ba Sing Se.  And you turned around and betrayed me, betrayed all of us!",16.0,3.0
Zuko, What can I do to make it up to you?,16.0,3.0
Katara," You really want to know? Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King.  Or, I know! You could bring my mother back!",16.0,3.0
Suki," Oops, wrong tent!",16.0,3.0
Zuko,"Sorry, do you need to talk to Sokka, too?",16.0,3.0
Suki,"Nope, not me! ",16.0,3.0
Sokka," Well, hello ...  Uh, Zuko! Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different?  So what's on your mind?",16.0,3.0
Zuko,"Your sister. She hates me! And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of me.",16.0,3.0
Sokka,"Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't  hate  anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation.  No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!",16.0,3.0
Zuko," Stop. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of nowhere, but I want you to tell me what happened to your mother.",16.0,3.0
Sokka, What? Why would you want to know that?,16.0,3.0
Zuko,"Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se, and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow she's connected her anger at that to her anger at me.",16.0,3.0
Sokka, It's not a day I like to remember.,16.0,3.0
Young Katara,I'm going to find Mom! ,16.0,3.0
Sokka," Many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant: a Fire Nation raid.  We were badly outnumbered, but somehow, we managed to drive them off. As quickly as they came, they just left.",16.0,3.0
Sokka,"I was so relieved when it was over, but that's because I didn't know yet what had happened. I didn't know we had lost our mother.",16.0,3.0
Zuko,Wait. Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village? Like what the lead ship looked like?,16.0,3.0
Sokka,Yeah ... sea ravens.  The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them.,16.0,3.0
Zuko,"The symbol of the Southern Raiders. Thanks, Sokka.",16.0,3.0
Sokka, No problem. Thanks for stopping by!  I'd thought he'd never leave.  Suki!,16.0,3.0
Katara, You look terrible.,16.0,3.0
Zuko,I waited out here all night.,16.0,3.0
Katara, What do you want?,16.0,3.0
Zuko,"I know who killed your mother,  and I'm going to help you find him.",16.0,3.0
Katara,I need to borrow Appa.,16.0,3.0
Aang, Why? Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?,16.0,3.0
Katara,"Yes, it is.",16.0,3.0
Aang, Oh. What's going on?,16.0,3.0
Katara,We're going to find the man who took my mother from me.,16.0,3.0
Zuko,Sokka told me the story of what happened. I know who did it and I know how to find him.,16.0,3.0
Aang,Um ... and what exactly do you think this will accomplish?,16.0,3.0
Katara," Ugh, I knew you wouldn't understand. ",16.0,3.0
Aang,Wait! Stop! I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?,16.0,3.0
Zuko,"She needs this, Aang. This is about getting closure and justice.",16.0,3.0
Aang,I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge.,16.0,3.0
Katara," Fine, maybe it is! Maybe that's what I need! Maybe that's what he deserves!",16.0,3.0
Aang,"Katara, you sound like Jet.",16.0,3.0
Katara,"It's not the same! Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster.",16.0,3.0
Sokka,"Katara, she was my mother, too, but I think Aang might be right.",16.0,3.0
Katara,Then you didn't love her the way I did!,16.0,3.0
Sokka, Katara!,16.0,3.0
Aang,"The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.",16.0,3.0
Zuko,"That's cute, but this isn't air temple preschool. It's the real world.",16.0,3.0
Katara,"Now that I know he's out there ... now that I know we can find him, I feel like I have no choice.",16.0,3.0
Aang,"Katara, you do have a choice: forgiveness.",16.0,3.0
Zuko,That's the same as doing nothing!,16.0,3.0
Aang,"No, it's not. It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive.",16.0,3.0
Katara,"It's not just hard, it's impossible. ",16.0,3.0

Zuko,That ... wasn't a good play.,17.0,3.0
Aang,I'll say.,17.0,3.0
Katara,No kidding.,17.0,3.0
Suki,Horrible.,17.0,3.0
Toph,You said it.,17.0,3.0
Sokka, But the effects were decent.,17.0,3.0
Zuko,More ferocious! Imagine striking through your opponent's heart!,18.0,3.0
Aang, I'm trying.,18.0,3.0
Zuko,Now let me hear you roar like a tigerdillo!  That sounded pathetic! I said  roar  !,18.0,3.0
Katara, Who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice?,18.0,3.0
Aang," Ooh, ooh! Me, me, me! ",18.0,3.0

Suki," Come on, Zuko. Just take a break. What's the big deal?",18.0,3.0
Zuko," Fine!  If you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day, then go ahead! ",18.0,3.0
Sokka,Maybe Zuko's right. Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know  just the thing to change all that.  Beach party!,18.0,3.0
Aang,Check out my Appa sand sculpture. ,18.0,3.0
Toph,"Not bad, baldy,  but I've been working on my sandbending.  You're gonna love this.",18.0,3.0
Aang," Whoa! Wow, you've even made a little Earth King and Bosco.",18.0,3.0
Toph,"Try and top  that  , Sokka.",18.0,3.0
Sokka, Ta da!,18.0,3.0
Aang,Is that a blubbering blob monster?,18.0,3.0
Sokka," No, it's Suki!",18.0,3.0
Toph,"Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this.",18.0,3.0

Aang, What are you doing?,18.0,3.0
Zuko,Teaching you a lesson!,18.0,3.0
Katara,What happened?,18.0,3.0
Sokka," Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki and he destroyed it!  Oh, and he's attacking Aang.",18.0,3.0
Aang,Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!,18.0,3.0
Zuko,Go ahead and do it!,18.0,3.0
Aang,Enough!,18.0,3.0
Katara, What's wrong with you? You could have hurt Aang!,18.0,3.0
Zuko,What's wrong with  me  ? What's wrong with all of you? How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet is only three days away?  Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy?,18.0,3.0
Aang,About Sozin's Comet ... I was actually gonna wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.,18.0,3.0
Zuko, After?,18.0,3.0
Aang,I'm not ready. I need more time to master firebending.,18.0,3.0
Toph,"And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too. ",18.0,3.0
Zuko,"So, you all knew Aang was going to wait?",18.0,3.0
Sokka,"Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord now, he's going to lose.  No offense.",18.0,3.0
Katara,"The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the Comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the War, but they pretty much won the War when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse.",18.0,3.0
Zuko,"You're wrong.  It's about to get worse than you can even imagine.  The day before the eclipse, my father asked me to attend an important war meeting. It was what I dreamed about for so many years. My father had finally accepted me back.",18.0,3.0
Ozai,"Welcome, Prince Zuko. We waited for you.  General Shinu, your report.",18.0,3.0
Shinu,"Thank you, sir.  Ba Sing Se is still under our control. However, earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving total victory in the Earth Kingdom.",18.0,3.0
Ozai,What is your recommendation?,18.0,3.0
Shinu,"Our army is spread too thin, but once the eclipse is over and the invasion defeated, we should transfer more domestic forces into the Earth Kingdom.",18.0,3.0
Ozai,"Hmm. Prince Zuko, you've been among the Earth Kingdom commoners. Do you think that adding more troops will stop these rebellions?",18.0,3.0
Zuko,"The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything, as long as they have hope.",18.0,3.0
Ozai,"Yes, you're right. We need to destroy their hope.",18.0,3.0
Zuko,"Well, that's not exactly what I-",18.0,3.0
Azula,I  think you should take their precious hope and the rest of their land and burn it all to the ground.,18.0,3.0
Ozai,"Yes ...  Yes you're right, Azula.  Sozin's Comet is almost upon us, and on that day, it will endow us with the strength and power of a hundred suns. No bender will stand a chance against us.",18.0,3.0
Shinu,"What are you suggesting, sir?",18.0,3.0
Ozai,"When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads.  Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom ...  permanently.  From our airships, we will rain fire over their lands, a fire that will destroy  everything  ; and out of the ashes, a new world will be born, a world in which  all  the lands are Fire Nation and  I  am the supreme ruler of everything! ",18.0,3.0
Zuko," I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan, but I'm ashamed to say I didn't.  My whole life, I struggled to gain my father's love and acceptance, but once I had it, I realized I'd lost myself getting there. I'd forgotten who I was.",18.0,3.0
Katara, I can't believe this.,18.0,3.0
Sokka,"I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy, but his plan is just pure evil.",18.0,3.0
Aang,What am I gonna do?,18.0,3.0
Zuko," I know you're scared, and I know you're not ready to save the world, but if you don't defeat the Fire Lord before the comet comes, there won't be a world to save anymore.",18.0,3.0
Aang,Why didn't you tell me about your dad's crazy plan sooner? ,18.0,3.0
Zuko,I didn't think I had to. I assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told  me  you decided to wait.,18.0,3.0
Aang," This is bad.  This is really, really bad.",18.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, you don't have to do this alone.",18.0,3.0
Toph,"Yeah, if we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down.",18.0,3.0
Sokka,All right! Team Avatar is back! Air.  Water.  Earth.  Fire.  Fan and sword! ,18.0,3.0
Aang,"Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together, but I wouldn't want to do it any other way.",18.0,3.0
Toph,Yeah.,18.0,3.0
Sokka,All right.,18.0,3.0
Katara,"Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.",18.0,3.0
Zuko,"There's one technique you need to know before facing my father - how to redirect lightning.  If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it.  You turn your opponents' energy against them.",18.0,3.0
Aang,That's like waterbending. ,18.0,3.0
Zuko,Exactly. My uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders.,18.0,3.0
Aang,"So, have  you  ever redirected lightning before?",18.0,3.0
Zuko,"Once, against my father.",18.0,3.0
Aang,What did it feel like?,18.0,3.0
Zuko," Exhilarating ...  but terrifying. You feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body, but you know if you make the wrong move, it's over.",18.0,3.0
Aang," Well, not  over  over. I mean there's always Katara and a little Spirit Water action,  am I right?",18.0,3.0
Katara,"Actually, I used it all up after Azula shot you.",18.0,3.0
Aang, Oh.,18.0,3.0
Zuko,You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life before he takes yours.,18.0,3.0
Aang,"Yeah, I'll just do that.",18.0,3.0
Sokka,"Gather round, Team Avatar.  In order to take out the Fire Lord - or in this case, the Melon Lord - our timing has to be perfect.  First, Suki and I will draw his fire. Then, Katara and Zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense,  and while the Melon Lord is distracted,  Aang swoops in ... and bam!  He delivers the final blow.",18.0,3.0
Toph,Uh ... what about me?,18.0,3.0
Sokka,"For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces.",18.0,3.0
Toph, So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?,18.0,3.0
Sokka,Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.,18.0,3.0
Toph,Sweetness.,18.0,3.0
Toph,Mwah-ha-ha-ha!,18.0,3.0
Sokka,"Watch it, Toph!",18.0,3.0
Toph,I am not Toph. I am Melon Lord! Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!,18.0,3.0
Sokka,"Now, Aang!",18.0,3.0
Zuko,What are you waiting for? Take him out!,18.0,3.0
Aang, I can't.,18.0,3.0
Sokka," What's wrong with you? If this was the real deal, you'd be shot full of lightning right now.",18.0,3.0
Aang,"I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself.",18.0,3.0
Sokka," There, that's how it's done.",18.0,3.0
Katara, I have a surprise for everyone!,18.0,3.0
Toph,I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru! ,18.0,3.0
Katara,"Uh, no.  I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this!  Look at baby Zuko. Isn't he cute?",18.0,3.0
Katara," Oh, lighten up. I'm just teasing.",18.0,3.0
Zuko,That's not me. It's my father.,18.0,3.0
Suki,But he looks so sweet and innocent.,18.0,3.0
Zuko,"Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers.",18.0,3.0
Aang, But he's still a human being.,18.0,3.0
Zuko,You're going to defend him?,18.0,3.0
Aang,"No, I agree with you.  Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way.",18.0,3.0
Zuko,Like what?,18.0,3.0
Aang,"I don't know.  Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore.",18.0,3.0
Zuko," Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again. ",18.0,3.0
Aang, Do you really think that would work?,18.0,3.0
Zuko, No!,18.0,3.0
Aang, This goes against everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like.,18.0,3.0
Sokka,"Sure you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you.",18.0,3.0
Aang," This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understand the position I'm in.",18.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, we do understand. It's just ...",18.0,3.0
Aang,"Just what, Katara? What?",18.0,3.0
Katara,We're trying to help!,18.0,3.0
Aang,"Then, when you figure out a way for me to beat the Fire Lord without taking his life, I'd love to hear it! ",18.0,3.0
Katara,"Aang, don't walk away from this. ",18.0,3.0
Zuko, Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself.,18.0,3.0
Aang," Hey, Momo. I don't suppose  you  know what I should do.  I didn't think so.",18.0,3.0
Sokka,"Okay, that's everything.",18.0,3.0
Toph,"No, it's not. Where's Aang?",18.0,3.0
Zuko,Aang? Aang!,18.0,3.0
Toph,"Come on, lazy bones, let's go.",18.0,3.0
Sokka,He left his staff.  That's so strange.,18.0,3.0
Zuko, Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach. ,18.0,3.0
Sokka,"Look, there's his footprints.  The trail ends here.",18.0,3.0
Suki,"So, he went for a midnight swim and never came back?",18.0,3.0
Katara,Maybe he was captured.,18.0,3.0
Sokka,I don't think so.  There's no sign of a struggle.,18.0,3.0
Toph,I bet he ran away again.,18.0,3.0
Sokka,Uh-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.,18.0,3.0
Toph,"Then what do  you  think happened to him, oh sleuthy one?",18.0,3.0
Sokka,It's pretty obvious. Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.,18.0,3.0
Zuko,"But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?",18.0,3.0
Sokka," Oh, yeah. Forgot about that.",18.0,3.0
Katara,Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him.,18.0,3.0
Toph,I'm going with Zuko!  What?! Everyone else went on a life-changing field trip with Zuko. Now it's my turn.,18.0,3.0
Crowd, Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! ,18.0,3.0
Actress Aang, Avatar State!  Yip-yip! ,18.0,3.0
Toph,"And then when I was nine, I ran away again.",18.0,3.0
Zuko,Uh-huh.,18.0,3.0
Toph,"I know I shouldn't complain. My parents gave me everything I ever asked for, but they never gave me the one thing I really wanted, their love. You know what I mean?",18.0,3.0
Zuko," Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang. ",18.0,3.0
Toph,This is the worst field trip ever. ,18.0,3.0
Sokka,"Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either. ",18.0,3.0
Zuko,No. It's like he just ... disappeared.,18.0,3.0
Toph,"Hey, wait a minute. Has anyone noticed that Momo is missing, too?",18.0,3.0
Sokka," Oh no! I knew it was only a matter of time!  Appa ate Momo!  Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy.",18.0,3.0
Katara,"Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang.",18.0,3.0
Sokka,That's just what Appa wants you to think. ,18.0,3.0
Zuko,"Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka. We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away.",18.0,3.0
Katara,What should we do Zuko?,18.0,3.0
Zuko, I don't know.  Why are you all looking at  me  ?,18.0,3.0
Katara,"Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang.",18.0,3.0
Toph,"Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar ... it's you.",18.0,3.0
Sokka,"Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there.",18.0,3.0
Zuko,Just trust me.,18.0,3.0
Azula, Come on slowpokes! Faster!,18.0,3.0
Azula," Sorry I'm late, father. Good palanquin bearers are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure?",18.0,3.0
Ozai," There has been a change of plans, Azula.",18.0,3.0
Azula, What?,18.0,3.0
Ozai,I've decided to lead the fleet of airships to Ba Sing Se alone. You will remain here in the Fire Nation.,18.0,3.0
Azula,But I thought we were going to do this together.,18.0,3.0
Ozai,My decision is final.,18.0,3.0
Azula,You ... you can't treat me like this!  You can't treat me like Zuko!,18.0,3.0
Ozai,"Azula, silence yourself.",18.0,3.0
Azula,But it was  my  idea to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side!,18.0,3.0
Ozai,Azula!  Listen to me. I need you here to watch over the homeland. It's a very important job that I can only entrust to you.,18.0,3.0
Azula,Really?,18.0,3.0
Ozai,"And for your loyalty, I've decided to declare you the new Fire Lord.",18.0,3.0
Azula,"Fire Lord Azula? It does seem appropriate, but what about you?",18.0,3.0
Ozai,"Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the world will be reborn in fire, I shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the world.  From this moment on, I will be known as ...  the Phoenix King.",18.0,3.0
Katara,And the reason you've brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?,18.0,3.0
Zuko, June.,18.0,3.0
Sokka," Oh yeah, that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole.",18.0,3.0
Suki, Mole? Her skin is flawless.,18.0,3.0
Sokka,"No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on.",18.0,3.0
Zuko,The shirshu. It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the world. It's the one shot we have of finding him.,18.0,3.0
Toph," I don't know who this June lady is, but I like her.",18.0,3.0
Aang," Hey, Momo. I just had the strangest dream.  Wait.  Where are we?",18.0,3.0
Sokka," Hey, I remember her!  She helped you attack us!",19.0,3.0
Zuko,Yup.  Back in the good old days.,19.0,3.0
June,Oh great. It's Prince Pouty.  Where's your creepy grandpa?,19.0,3.0
Zuko, He's my uncle. And he's not here.,19.0,3.0
June, I see you worked things out with your girlfriend.,19.0,3.0
Katara, I'm not his girlfriend!,19.0,3.0
Zuko, She's not my girlfriend!,19.0,3.0
June," Okay, okay. Sheesh. I was only teasing. So what do you want?",19.0,3.0
Zuko, I need your help finding the Avatar.,19.0,3.0
June,Hm. Doesn't sound too fun. ,19.0,3.0
Zuko, Does the end of the world sound like more fun?,19.0,3.0
June," Nyla.  Who's my little, hmm, Snuffly-Wuffly?  Whoa! Careful there.  Okay. So who's got something with the Avatar's scent on it?",19.0,3.0
Katara, I have Aang's staff.,19.0,3.0
Zuko," Well, what does that mean?",19.0,3.0
June, Means your friend's gone.,19.0,3.0
Toph, We know he's gone. That's why we're trying to find him.,19.0,3.0
June," No, I mean he's  gone  gone.  He doesn't exist.",19.0,3.0
Aang,"Where are we, Momo?  Maybe I'm in the Spirit World?  But wait. You can see me.  We could both be in the Spirit World.  Nope. My bending works.  Maybe if we climb to the top of the island, we can figure out where we are.",19.0,3.0
Sokka," What do you mean Aang doesn't exist?  Do you mean he's ... you know, dead?",19.0,3.0
June," Nope. We could find him if he were dead. Wow, it's a real head-scratcher. See ya. ",19.0,3.0
Toph, Helpful. Real helpful.,19.0,3.0
Zuko, Wait. I have another idea.  There's only one other person in this world who can help us face the Fire Lord. I'll be right back with a smell sample.,19.0,3.0
Sokka,You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal? Ugh! ,19.0,3.0
Toph, I think it's kind of sweet.,19.0,3.0
June, Let's do this. ,19.0,3.0
Zuko,Hey! Wait up!,19.0,3.0
Zuko,We're going to Ba Sing Se?,19.0,3.0
June, Your uncle's somewhere beyond the wall.  Nyla's getting twitchy so he can't be too far.  Good luck.,19.0,3.0
Zuko,It's been a long day.  Let's camp and start our search again at dawn.,19.0,3.0
Aang,It's a hexagon.  It doesn't seem like normal rock.  It's not made of earth.  This is so strange.  I wish I had some help right now. I wish I had Roku.  I  do  have Roku! ,19.0,3.0
Avatar Roku,"You're right, Aang.  All the past Avatars, all their experience and wisdom, is available to you  if you look deep inside yourself.",19.0,3.0
Aang," So where am I, Roku? What is this place?",19.0,3.0
Avatar Roku," I ... don't know, Aang.  But I see you are lost in more ways than one right now.",19.0,3.0
Aang,I am. I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord.,19.0,3.0
Toph, Huh? ,19.0,3.0
Bumi,"Well, look who's here! ",19.0,3.0
Aang,"Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life,  but I just don't know if I can do that.",19.0,3.0
Avatar Roku," In my life, I tried to be disciplined and show restraint, but it backfired when Fire Lord Sozin took advantage of my restraint and mercy.  If I had been more decisive and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin and stopped the war before it started.  I offer you this wisdom, Aang: You must be decisive. ",19.0,3.0
Toph, What's going on?  We're surrounded by old people.,19.0,3.0
Katara,Not just any old people.  These are great masters and friends of ours.  Pakku.,19.0,3.0
Pakku," It is respectful to bow to an old master,  but how about a hug for your new grandfather?",19.0,3.0
Katara, That's so exciting!  You and Gran-Gran must be so happy to have found each other again!,19.0,3.0
Pakku,I made her a new betrothal necklace and everything.,19.0,3.0
Sokka," Welcome to the family, Gramp-Gramp!",19.0,3.0
Pakku, You can still just call me Pakku.,19.0,3.0
Sokka, How about Grand-Pakku?,19.0,3.0
Pakku, No. ,19.0,3.0
Katara, And this was Aang's first firebending teacher.,19.0,3.0
Jeong Jeong, Jeong Jeong.,19.0,3.0
Sokka, Master Piandao.,19.0,3.0
Piandao," Hello, Sokka.",19.0,3.0
Suki, So wait. How do you all know each other?,19.0,3.0
Bumi, All old people know each other. Don't you know that? ,19.0,3.0
Piandao,We're all part of the same ancient secret society. A group that transcends the divisions of the four nations.,19.0,3.0
Zuko, The Order of the White Lotus.,19.0,3.0
Bumi, That's the one. ,19.0,3.0
Jeong Jeong,"The White Lotus has always been about philosophy and beauty and truth.  But about a month ago, a call went out that we were needed for something important.",19.0,3.0
Pakku," It came from a Grand Lotus: your uncle,  Iroh of the Fire Nation. ",19.0,3.0
Toph," Well, that's who we're looking for.",19.0,3.0
Piandao, Then we'll take you to him.,19.0,3.0
Bumi, Wait! Someone's missing from your group.  Someone very important.  Where's Momo?,19.0,3.0
Sokka, He's gone.  And so is Aang.,19.0,3.0
Bumi," Oh well.  So long as they have each other, I'm sure we have nothing to worry about. Let's go! ",19.0,3.0
Aang,Avatar Kyoshi. I need your wisdom.,19.0,3.0
