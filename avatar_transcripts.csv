Katara,"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.",1
Sokka,"It's not getting away from me this time. [  Close-up of Sokka as he grins confidently over his shoulder in the direction of Katara.  ] Watch and learn, Katara.  This  is how you catch a fish.",1
Katara,"[  Happily surprised.  ] Sokka, look!",1
Sokka,"[  Close-up of Sokka; whispering.  ] Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away. [  A look of bliss adorns his face. He licks his lips and wiggles his fingers, not taking his eyes off the fish.  ] Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'.",1
Katara,"[  Struggling with the water that passes right in front of her.  ] But, Sokka! I caught one!",1
Katara,[  Exclaims indignantly.  ] Hey!,1
Sokka,"Why is it that every time  you  play with magic water,  I  get soaked?",1
Katara,"[  Cut to her face; she sighs lightly before answering in slight annoyance.  ] It's not ""magic"", it's waterbending! And it's ...",1
Sokka,"[  Cutting her off.  ] Yeah, yeah, ""an ancient art unique to our culture"", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying [  Grabbing his warrior's wolf knot with his left hand as he turns away from her, wringing the water out of it. Meanwhile, Katara has crossed her arms.  ] that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.",1
Katara,"[  Cut to her face as she raises an eyebrow skeptically, arms still crossed.  ] You're calling  me  weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!",1
Katara,Watch out! Go left! Go left!,1
Katara,[  A touch of bitterness in her voice.  ] You call that  left?,1
Sokka,"You don't like my steering? Well, maybe you should've [  He waves his hands, mockingly imitating waterbending.  ]  waterbended  us out of the ice.",1
Katara,[  Indignantly.  ] So it's my fault?,1
Sokka,[  Annoyed.  ] I  knew  I should've left you home! [  Cut to a close-up of the siblings; Katara is staring down at her brother in anger while he rants calmly.  ] Leave it to a girl to screw things up!,1
Katara,"You are the most sexist, [  She brings her hands up to her head and swings them back down and behind her in her rage; the movement creates a small wave of water behind her.  ] immature, [  Hands raised back to her head.  ] nut brained ... [  Swings her arms back down again, creating a slightly larger wave; she raises her hands back to her head during a brief loss for words.  ] I'm embarrassed [  Throwing a hand upward, a short jet of water shoots upward as well.  ] to be related to you!",1
Katara,"Ever since mom died, [  Points to herself.  ]  I've  been doing all the work around camp while  you've  been off playing soldier!",1
Sokka,"[  Pointing to the iceberg behind her, his voice subdued by fright.  ] Uh ... Katara ...",1
Katara,"[  Close-up of a rage-fueled Katara as she continues her outburst, a finger pointed in Sokka's face.  ] I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you,  not pleasant!",1
Sokka,"[  In a screeching voice, his eyes open wide in fear.  ] Katara, settle down!",1
Katara,"No that's it! I'm  done  helping you! From now on, you're  on your own!",1
Sokka,"Okay, you've gone from ""weird"" to ""freakish"", [  He releases her.  ] Katara.",1
Katara,[  Astonished.  ] You mean  I  did that?,1
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically, glancing at her and smirking.  ] Yep. [  Nudging her with his elbow.  ] Congratulations.",1
Katara,He's alive! We have to help!,1
Sokka,"Katara, get back here! [  He grabs his spear from the ice and runs after Katara, who is already at the ice's edge.  ] We don't know what that  thing  is!",1
Zuko,"Finally! [  He turns around to face another person in uniform, who sits at a small table.  ] Uncle, do you realize what this means?!",1
Iroh,[  He is playing some sort of card game. He answers calmly while looking over the tile he's holding toward his nephew.  ] I won't get to finish my game?,1
Zuko,[  Turning around again to face the light.  ] It means my search is about to come to an end.,1
Zuko,[  Gestures at the light while facing his uncle again.  ] That light came from an  incredibly  powerful source! [  The light dwindles and disappears.  ] It has to be him!,1
Iroh,"[  With continuing disinterest and an air of skepticism.  ] Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. [  He looks at the tile in his hand, depicting the symbol of airbending.  ] I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. [  He places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures toward the open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed voice.  ] Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?",1
Zuko,"[  Furiously, still facing Iroh.  ] I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar! Helmsman, head a course for the light!",1
Sokka,[  Brandishing his spear in defense once again.  ] Stop!,1
Katara,[  Waves the spear away. Annoyed.  ] Stop it!,1
Aang,[  In a weak voice.  ] I need to ask you something ...,1
Katara,What?,1
Aang,Please ... come closer.,1
Katara,[  Curiously.  ] What is it?,1
Aang,"[  In a clear, happy, hopeful tone.  ] Will you go penguin sledding with me?",1
Katara,"[  Awkwardly.  ] Uh, sure ... I-I guess.",1
Aang,"[  Looking around and rubbing his head, while Katara scrambles on her feet.  ] What's going on here?",1
Sokka,[  Aggressively.  ] You tell us! [  Points at the top of the crater.  ] How did you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen? [  He pokes the boy in his side with his spear.  ],1
Aang,[  Lazily pushes the spear away.  ] I'm not sure.,1
Aang,"[  Exclaims happily.  ] Appa! Are you all right? [  He hangs down the side of the beast to look at its eyes, which are still closed.  ] Wake up, buddy.",1
Aang,"[  Laughing cheerfully.  ] Ha, ha! You're okay!",1
Sokka,What  is  that thing?,1
Aang,"This is Appa, my flying bison.",1
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Right, and this is Katara, my flying sister. [  Katara shoots him an odd look.  ]",1
Aang,"[  Cheerfully.  ] Don't worry, it'll wash out. [  Green snot is hanging from Sokka's face to his glove, dripping down as he retracts his hand. Katara covers her mouth in disgust.  ] So do you guys live around here?",1
Sokka,[  Pointing his spear accusingly again at Aang who is surprised to see the thing.  ]  Don't  answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light?! He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy!,1
Katara,"[  Pushes Sokka's spear away again and addresses him sarcastically.  ] Oh yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that  evil  look in his eye. [  Aang shoots the two an earnest grin.  ] The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.",1
Aang,"I'm A ... a-a-a-Achoo! [  The boy sneezes, creating an air blast that sends him soaring into the air. He lands on the ground, unharmed.  ] I'm Aang. [  He sniffles a bit.  ]",1
Sokka,[  Total disbelief.  ] You just sneezed ... [  Points to the sky.  ] and flew ten feet in the air!,1
Aang,[  He looks questioningly toward the sky.  ] Really? It felt higher than that.,1
Katara,[  Gasps for air in comprehension.  ] You're an airbender!,1
Aang,Sure am!,1
Sokka,"Giant light beams, flying bison, airbenders ... [  Walks away.  ] I think I got midnight sun madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense. [  He realizes, however, that he is stranded in the middle of the ocean with no way home.  ]",1
Aang,"Well, if you guys are stuck, Appa and I can give you a lift. [  Aang airbends himself onto Appa.  ]",1
Katara,We'd love a ride! Thanks! [  Katara runs to the side of the bison.  ],1
Sokka,Oh no! I'm not getting on that fluffy  snot  monster!,1
Katara,"[  While climbing on top of Appa with the help of Aang.  ] Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know, before you  freeze  to death?",1
Aang,"Okay, first time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip-yip!",1
Aang,"Come on, Appa. Yip-yip!",1
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Wow, that was  truly  amazing ...",1
Aang,"[  Katara shoots her brother an angry glance.  ] Appa's just a little tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see. [  Katara smiles at Aang, who returns this gesture. When she wants to move back, she realizes that he is still smiling at her.  ]",1
Katara,[  Uncomfortably.  ] Why are you smiling at me like that?,1
Aang,"Oh, I was smiling? [  Flattered, Katara smiles back.  ]",1
Iroh,"I'm going to bed now. [  Yawns and stretches.  ] Yep, a man needs his rest. [  After a short pause, he abandons his try at a veiled suggestion and delivers his request more clearly, his tone tired.  ] Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed.",1
Zuko,Because their  honor  didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine  does.  This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.,1
Katara,Hey.,1
Aang,Hey. What'cha thinkin' about?,1
Katara,"I guess I was wondering, your being an airbender and all, if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar?",1
Aang,"Oh, no. I didn't know him. I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry. [  He smiles weakly at Katara.  ]",1
Katara,Okay. Just curious. [  She slants her eyes in disappointment for a second before smiling again at Aang.  ] Good night.,1
Aang,Sleep tight.,1
Katara,"Aang? Aang! Wake up. [  Aang shoots up, throwing the covers of his body and gasping for air. Katara perches beside him and stands up as she sees that Aang is awake.  ] It's okay, we're in the village now! Come on, get ready. [  She points to the door of the tent.  ] Everyone's waiting to meet you.",1
Katara,"Aang,  this  is the entire village. [  Points to the line of villagers in front of them.  ] Entire village, Aang.",1
Aang,"[  Uncomfortably.  ] Uh, why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?",1
Kanna,"Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years. We thought they were extinct, until my granddaughter and grandson found you.",1
Aang,[  Shocked disbelief.  ] Extinct?,1
Katara,"[  Gesturing.  ] Aang, this is my grandmother.",1
Kanna,"[  Flatly, with a dull look on her face.  ] Call me Gran-Gran.",1
Sokka,"[  Annoyed.  ] What is this, a weapon? You can't  stab  anything with this!",1
Aang,"[  Aang uses a small air current to get his staff back.  ] It's not for stabbing! It's for airbending. [  He opens his staff into a glider, making Sokka gasp in fright and cover his head with his hands.  ]",1
Village girl,[  Excited.  ] Magic trick! Do it again!,1
Aang,"Not magic, airbending. [  He moves his glider around him, visually demonstrating what he is talking about.  ] It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.",1
Sokka,"[  Mockingly states his disbelief.  ] Ya know, last time I checked, humans  can't fly!",1
Aang,"[  Accepting Sokka's challenge, smiling.  ] Check again!",1
Village girl,[  In admiration.  ] He's flying!,1
Village girl,It's amazing!,1
Sokka,[  Shocked.  ] My watchtower!,1
Katara,[  Offering her hand to pull him out of the snow.  ] That was  amazing!,1
Sokka,"[  Annoyed.  ] Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender. Together you can just waste time  all  day long. [  He wedges himself free from underneath the weight of the snow and stalks off.  ]",1
Aang,[  Surprised and with admiration.  ] You're a waterbender?,1
Katara,"[  Nervously.  ] Well, sort of. Not yet.",1
Kanna,"All right, no more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.",1
Katara,"[  Excitedly.  ] I told you, he's the real thing Gran-Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me!",1
Kanna,"[  Calmly.  ] Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.",1
Katara,But he's special! I can tell! [  Clenches her fist and closes her eyes in hope.  ] I sense he's filled with  much  wisdom.,1
Aang,[  Muffled.  ] See? Now my tongue is stuck to my staff!,1
Iroh,[  Sternly.  ] Again.,1
Iroh,"[  Sighs while he gets up.  ] No! [  Zuko lowers his arms and looks at his uncle.  ] Power in firebending comes from the breath [  Iroh moves his both hand up in front of him to emphasize the breathing motion.  ], not the muscles. [  He stretches his left arm out as if he was sending a fire blast.  ] The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire! [  Iroh directs a fire blast at his nephew that evaporates just before it would scorch him.  ] Get it right this time.",1
Zuko,"[  With suppressed anger, he walks toward his uncle and addresses him.  ] Enough! I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set! I'm  more  than ready!",1
Iroh,"No, you are impatient. [  He sits down again on his chair.  ] You have yet to master your basics. [  He yells his order.  ] Drill it again!",1
Zuko,"[  The suppressed anger is very apparent in his voice.  ] The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. [  Close-up of Iroh, who does not look pleased with the attitude of his nephew.  ] He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements! I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. [  Starts to yell at his uncle.  ] You  will  teach me the advanced set!",1
Iroh,"[  Concedes reluctantly. On a dire tone.  ] Very well, [  His expression changes completely to one of delight as he picks something up from the ground.  ] but first, I must finish my roast duck. [  He quickly munches down the roast duck, much to the dismay of Zuko.  ]",1
Sokka,"[  With a stern expression.  ] Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. [  He brings out his club and holds it proudly.  ] In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing! For without courage, how can we call ourselves men? [  He clutches his fist to emphasize the word ""men"" as he stares down the people in front of him.  ]",1
Southern Water Tribe boy,[  Waving his hand in the air.  ] I gotta pee!,1
Sokka,"[  Angrily.  ] Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on  you  to be the men of this tribe, and that means  no potty breaks  ! [  He makes some wide arm gestures to emphasize his words again.  ]",1
Southern Water Tribe boy,But I really gotta go!,1
Sokka,"[  Sighs.  ] Okay, who else has to go?",1
Katara,[  Runs up to Sokka as the children leave. In a worried tone.  ] Have you seen Aang? Gran-Gran said he disappeared over  an hour  ago.,1
Aang,[  Amused.  ] Wow!  Everything  freezes in there!,1
Sokka,"[  Annoyed.  ] Uh! [  Angrily points at Aang.  ] Katara, get him out of here! This lesson is for warriors  only  !",1
Village boy,Whee!,1
Sokka,"[  Yelling angrily.  ] Stop! Stop it right now! [  The laughter of the children is stifled immediately and Appa turns his head to look at Sokka, who accusingly directs his anger to Aang.  ] What's wrong with you?! We don't have time for fun and games with  the War  going on!",1
Aang,[  Slides down from Appa's head.  ] What war? What are you talking about?,1
Sokka,"[  Raises one eyebrow in disbelief.  ] You're kidding, right?",1
Aang,[  Exclaims enthusiastically.  ] Penguin!,1
Sokka,"He's kidding, right?",1
Katara,Aang?,1
Aang,"[  Chasing the penguins while laughing.  ] Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding? [  He jumps at a penguin, but the animal evades his attempt and Aang belly flops into the snow. He turns on his back and quickly erects himself with his airbending as Katara comes up beside him.  ] Heh heh. I have a way with animals.",1
Katara,"[  Amused.  ] Hehehe, Aang, I'll help  you  catch a penguin if you teach  me  waterbending.",1
Aang,"[  Having grabbed the tail of a penguin, he holds on as it pulls him through the snow for a short way before letting go and looking up at Katara.  ] You got a deal! Just one little problem ... [  He airbends himself into a sitting position.  ] I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?",1
Katara,[  Sadly.  ] No. You're looking at the  only  waterbender in the whole South Pole.,1
Aang,"This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. [  He thinks for a moment.  ] What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.",1
Katara,"Maybe, but we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly ""turn right at the second glacier"". It's on the other side of  the world  .",1
Aang,"But you forget,  I  have a flying bison. [  He happily points at himself.  ] Appa and I can  personally  fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're going to find you a master!",1
Katara,"[  Unsure.  ] That's ... I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before.",1
Aang,"Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?",1
Katara,"[  Mockingly imitating a teacher.  ] Okay, listen closely my young pupil. [  Inclines her head toward Aang.  ] Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. [  She conjures a fish out of her sleeve.  ] Observe!",1
Aang,"Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha!",1
Katara,[  Happily.  ] I haven't done this since I was a kid!,1
Aang,You still  are  a kid!,1
Aang,[  In awe.  ] Whoa! What is  that?,1
Katara,"[  On a slightly dark tone.  ] A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people. [  Aang begins to approach the wreckage.  ] Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped!",1
Aang,"If you want to be a bender, you  have  to let go of fear.",1
Katara,"[  Her voice echoes through the room.  ] This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl. [  The camera shifts through the room, revealing all the weapons more closely.  ] It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.",1
Aang,"Okay, back up. I have friends  all over  the world, even in the Fire Nation. [  Aang picks up a Guan Dao to inspect it.  ] I've never seen  any  war.",1
Katara,"Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?",1
Aang,"[  Uncertain.  ] I don't know. A few days, maybe?",1
Katara,I think it was more like a hundred  years!,1
Aang,[  In full disbelief and slightly accusing.  ] What?! That's impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you?,1
Katara,"Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there the whole time! [  Aang's expression changes to one of comprehension.  ] It's the only explanation.",1
Aang,A hundred years! [  Saddened by his new discovery.  ] I can't believe it.,1
Katara,"[  Squats beside him.  ] I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this ...",1
Aang,[  Cheerfully.  ] I  did  get to meet you.,1
Katara,"[  Smiling warmly at him while offering her hand.  ] Come on, let's get out of here.",1
Katara,"Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy.",1
Aang,Huh?,1
Aang,What's that you said about booby traps?,1
Aang,Uh oh ... [  Aang notices a hole in the roof of the ship and takes a surprised Katara into his arms.  ] Hold on tight!,1
Katara,Aaah!,1
Zuko,The last airbender! [  Aang and Katara reach the ground again and Aang sets Katara down. They start to walk away.  ] Quite agile for his old age. [  He turns and angrily yells to a soldier behind him.  ] Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar. [  Zuko peeks through his telescope again to see that Katara and Aang are running now. Zuko follows the direction they are running in with his telescope and discovers that they must be headed for the village he spots.  ] As  well  as his hiding place ...,1
Katara,"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.",2
Village kids,[  Joyfully.  ] Yay! Aang's back!,2
Sokka,"[  Angrily.  ] I knew it! [  Accusingly points a finger at Aang as he and Katara draw closer.  ] You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?",2
Katara,[  Protesting.  ] Aang didn't do anything! It was an accident.,2
Aang,"[  Sheepishly, as Katara glares at Sokka.  ] Yeah. We were on the ship and there was this booby trap, and, well -- [  Awkwardly rubs his head.  ] -- we booby-ed right into it.",2
Kanna,"[  Worriedly.  ] Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship! Now we could  all  be in danger!",2
Aang,[  Sorrowfully.  ] Don't blame Katara. I brought her there. It's my fault.,2
Sokka,"[  Angry and triumphant, having found an excuse.  ] Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy. [  The children begin to sadly walk away.  ] The foreigner is banished from our village.",2
Katara,"[  Irritably, clenching her fists.  ] Sokka, you're making a mistake.",2
Sokka,"[  Stubbornly persisting in his anger.  ] No, I'm keeping my promise to Dad. [  Pointing to Aang.  ] I'm protecting you, from threats like him!",2
Katara,"[  Angrily.  ] Aang is  not  our enemy! [  Continues in a calm, soothing voice.  ] Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time: fun.",2
Sokka,[  Annoyed.  ] Fun?! We can't fight firebenders with fun!,2
Aang,[  Optimistically.  ] You should try it sometime.,2
Sokka,[  Angrily.  ] Get out of our village!  Now!,2
Katara,"[  Pleading.  ] Grandmother, please.  Don't  let Sokka do this!",2
Kanna,"[  Gravely.  ] Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden. Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves.",2
Katara,"[  Outraged.  ] Fine! Then I'm banished, too! [  Drags Aang away.  ] Come on Aang, let's go.",2
Sokka,[  Demanding.  ] Where do you think  you're  going?,2
Katara,[  Angrily.  ] To find a waterbender. Aang is taking  me  to the North Pole.,2
Aang,[  Confusedly.  ] I am? [  Brightening.  ] Great!,2
Sokka,Katara! Would you really choose him over your tribe? [  Shows shot of the entire Southern Water Tribe.  ] Your own family?,2
Aang,"[  Understanding.  ] Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.",2
Katara,"[  Upset.  ] So, you're leaving the South Pole? [  In a quieter tone.  ] This is goodbye?",2
Aang,Thanks for penguin sledding with me.,2
Katara,[  Still in that quiet tone.  ] Where will you go?,2
Aang,"Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders. [  He places one hand on Appa, but is suddenly struck with realization.  ] Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to  that.  [  He uses his airbending to hop onto Appa's head.  ] It was nice meeting everyone.",2
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically, with arms crossed.  ] Let's see your bison fly now,  air boy.",2
Aang,"[  Encouragingly.  ] Come on Appa, you can do it. Yip-yip!",2
Sokka,"[  Mockingly.  ] Yeah, I thought so!",2
Southern Water Tribe girl,"[  Runs from crowd to stand next to Katara with tears in her eyes.  ] Ahhh! [  Close-up.  ] Aang, don't go! I'll miss you!",2
Aang,"[  Sadly.  ] I'll miss you, too. [  Looks at Katara, who frowns back at him, her eyes saddened while her hair loopies sway in the wind.  ] Come on, boy.",2
Kanna,"[  Consoling tone.  ] Katara, you'll feel better after you- [  Katara quickly turns around and cuts her off.  ]",2
Katara,"[  Rounding on Kanna and interrupting her, her voice full of empassioned rage.  ] You happy now? [  Gestures in the direction Aang took off.  ] There goes my  one  chance at becoming a waterbender!",2
Sokka,"All right, ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!",2
Southern Water Tribe boy,[  Stopping and dancing around.  ] But I gotta ...,2
Sokka,"[  Authoritatively, a twinge of annoyance in his voice; he points onward, ushering the boy in that direction.  ] And  no  potty breaks!",2
Aang,"[  Sorrowfully.  ] Yeah, I liked her too. [  Catches sight of Fire Nation ship advancing toward the Southern Water Tribe; gasps.  ] The village! [  He slides off the ice formation onto the ground.  ] Appa, wait here.",2
Sokka,[  Disappointed at the tower's collapse.  ] Oh man!,2
Sokka,[  Horrified.  ] Oh maaan ...,2
Katara,"[  Hysterically.  ] Sokka, get out of the way!",2
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] Where are you hiding him?,2
Zuko,"[  Shaking Kanna; annoyed.  ] He'd be about this age, master of  all  elements?",2
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] I  know  you're hiding him!,2
Village boy,Show no fear!,2
Aang,"[  Cheerfully, despite the present situation.  ] Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka.",2
Sokka,"[  Moodily.  ] Hi, Aang. Thanks for coming.",2
Aang,Looking for me?,2
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ]  You're  the airbender?  You're  the Avatar?,2
Katara,[  Surprised.  ] Aang?,2
Sokka,[  Bewildered.  ] No way!,2
Zuko,"I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training, meditating. [  Angrily.  ] You're just a child!",2
Aang,"[  Calmly, tilting his head to one side with a somewhat confused expression.  ] Well, you're just a teenager.",2
Aang,"If I go with you, [  He holds his staff in front of him as an offer, making sure Zuko understands that he does not wish to continue fighting.  ] will you promise to leave everyone alone?",2
Katara,"[  Sadly.  ] No! Aang,  don't  do this!",2
Aang,"[  Surprisingly calm.  ] Don't worry, Katara. It'll be okay. [  He gasps when he is shoved on the walkway. Katara's face contorts with sadness and fright.  ] Take care of Appa for me until I get back.",2
Zuko,[  Boarding the ship up the walkway. Determined.  ] Head a course for the Fire Nation. I'm going home.,2
Katara,"[  Sokka is seen in the background, carrying a pack as she speaks on a determined tone.  ] We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him.",2
Sokka,"Katara, I --",2
Katara,"[  Making arm gestures to emphasize her words while she speaks in an objective tone.  ] Why can't you realize that he's on our side? [  Cuts to shot of her and her brother, her back to the screen.  ] If we don't help him, no one will. I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and --",2
Sokka,"[  Cutting her off.  ] Katara! [  Slightly annoyed.  ] Are you gonna talk all day, or are you comin' with me?",2
Katara,[  Running over to her brother.  ] Sokka! [  She gives him a hug.  ],2
Sokka,"[  Inviting.  ] Get in, we're going to save your boyfriend.",2
Katara,[  Annoyed.  ] He's not my --,2
Sokka,"[  Shrugging, nonchalant.  ] Whatever.",2
Kanna,[  Accusingly.  ] What do you two think you're doing?,2
Kanna,"[  Smiling warmly.  ] You'll need these. [  Kanna holds up their sleeping bags.  ] You have a long journey ahead of you. [  The siblings glance at each other in surprise. Kanna walks over to face Katara.  ] It's been so long since I've had hope, but you brought it back to life, my little waterbender. [  Hugs Katara and who at the end takes the sleeping back out of her hands; to Sokka.  ] And you, my brave warrior, be nice to your sister.",2
Sokka,"[  Kanna hugs Sokka, who, slightly embarrassed, pats her back.  ] Yeah, okay Gran. [  He smiles broadly when she releases him.  ]",2
Kanna,Aang is the Avatar. He's the world's only chance. You both found him for a reason. Now your destinies are intertwined with his.,2
Katara,[  Pointing at the ready canoe.  ] There's no way we're going to catch a warship with a  canoe.,2
Katara,[  Brightly.  ] Appa! [  Begins running toward the bison.  ],2
Sokka,"[  Annoyed.  ] You just looove taking me out of my comfort zone, don't you?",2
Zuko,"This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. [  Inspects the staff further.  ] I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. [  To his soldiers.  ] Take the Avatar to the prison hold, [  Handing the staff to Iroh.  ] and take this to my quarters.",2
Iroh,"[  Turns to one of Zuko's men and gives him the staff; casually.  ] Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?",2
Aang,"[  Slyly.  ] So, I guess you've never fought an airbender before. I bet I could take you  both  with my hands tied behind my back.",2
Firebender,[  Unamused.  ] Silence.,2
Firebender,The Avatar has escaped!,2
Sokka,[  Unamused.  ] Go. Fly. [  Katara glances annoyed at her brother.  ] Soar.,2
Katara,"[  Pleading as Appa growls again.  ] Please, Appa. We need your help.  Aang  needs your help.",2
Sokka,[  Blandly.  ] Up. Ascend. Elevate.,2
Katara,"Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa. [  Strokes Appa.  ] Come on, don't you want to save Aang? [  Appa grunts.  ]",2
Sokka,What was it that kid said? Yee-haw? Hup-hup? Wah-hoo? Uh ... Yip-yip?,2
Katara,"[  Thrilled.  ] You did it, Sokka!",2
Sokka,"[  Ecstatically looking over the rim of the saddle.  ] He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's -",2
Sokka,"[  Sheepishly.  ] I mean, big deal. He's flying. [  Brightens quickly.  ]",2
Aang,"You haven't seen my staff around, have you?",2
Aang,[  Off camera.  ] Thanks anyway!,2
Aang,[  Whispering.  ] Sorry!,2
Aang,My staff!,2
Zuko,Looks like I underestimated you.,2
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ] What is that?,2
Aang,[  Ecstatic.  ] Appa!,2
Katara,[  Horrified.  ] Aang! No!,2
Katara,[  Voice-over.  ] Aang! Aang! Aang!,2
Katara,[  Shocked.  ] Did you see what he just did?!,2
Sokka,[  Impressed.  ] Now  that  was some waterbending!,2
Katara,[  Worried.  ] Aang! Are you okay?,2
Aang,"[  Weakly.  ] Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka. Thanks for coming.",2
Sokka,"Well, I couldn't let you have  all  the glory.",2
Aang,[  Weakly.  ] I dropped my staff.,2
Sokka,[  Rising.  ] Got it!,2
Sokka,[  Triumphantly.  ] Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!,2
Sokka,[  Complaining.  ] Katara!,2
Katara,"[  Urgently.  ] Hurry up, Sokka!",2
Sokka,"[  Muttering to himself, as he uses his boomerang to chip the ice.  ] I'm just a guy, with a boomerang. [  He frees his left foot.  ] I didn't ask for all this flying and  magic!  [  He manages to break free and races up Appa's tail.  ] Yip-yip! Yip-yip!",2
Iroh,[  Rubbing eyes and staring up at Appa in surprise.  ] Duh? Huh?,2
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] Shoot them down!,2
Iroh,[  Calmly.  ] Good news for the Fire Lord. The Fire Nation's greatest  threat  is just a little kid.,2
Zuko,"[  Holding back rage.  ] That ""kid"", Uncle, just did  this.  [  Cuts to a shot of the damaged ship, the whole front covered in ice and snow.  ] I won't underestimate him again. [  Yells his order to the soldiers and points at the piles of snow.  ] Dig the ship out and follow them!",2
Zuko,[  Slightly embarrassed.  ] As soon as you're done with that.,2
Katara,[  Bewildered.  ] How did you do that?! With the water? It was the most  amazing  thing I've  ever  seen!,2
Aang,"[  Quietly, slightly downcast, sitting on the edge of the saddle.  ] I don't know. I just sort of ... did it.",2
Katara,"[  Curious, but serious.  ] Why didn't you tell us  you  were the Avatar?",2
Aang,Because ... [  Turns away slightly; saddened.  ] I never wanted to be.,2
Katara,"But Aang, the world's been  waiting  for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.",2
Aang,[  Downcast.  ] And how am I going to do that?,2
Katara,"According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?",2
Aang,[  Looking at Katara.  ] That's what the monks told me.,2
Katara,"[  Brightening a bit.  ] Well, if we go to the North Pole, you can master waterbending!",2
Aang,"[  Turning to face her, smiling and brightening up completely.  ] We can learn it together!",2
Katara,"[  Faces her brother; cheerfully.  ] And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.",2
Sokka,[  Content.  ] I'd like that. I'd  reeally  like that.,2
Katara,[  Optimistically.  ] Then we're in this together!,2
Aang,"[  Cheerfully, pulling out a rolled up scroll.  ] All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some  serious  business to attend to. [  He uses airbending to situate himself onto the saddle and unrolls the scroll, revealing a map of the Avatar World.  ] Here, here and here.",2
Katara,[  Curiously.  ] What's there? [  Points to one of the locations.  ],2
Aang,"[  Points to the location in Earth Kingdom.  ] Here, we'll ride the hopping llamas. [  Points to the location in Air Nomad territory.  ] Then waaay over here, we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. [  Katara and Sokka stare at him in wonder.  ] Then back over here, we'll ride the hog monkeys. [  The siblings glance at each other.  ] They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!",2
Aang,"[  Excitedly.  ] Wait 'til you see it, Katara! The Air Temple is one of the most  beautiful  places in the world!",3
Katara,"[  Cautiously.  ] Aang, I know you're excited, [  She turns around to face him.  ] but it's been a hundred years since you've been home.",3
Aang,[  Smiling broadly.  ] That's  why  I'm so excited!,3
Katara,[  Cautiously.  ] It's just that ... a lot can change in all that time.,3
Aang,"[  Happily.  ] I know, but I need to see it for myself.",3
Aang,"[  Cheerfully.  ] Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple, here we come! [  Sokka awakens, making groggy noises.  ]",3
Sokka,[  Grunting sleepily.  ] Uggh! Sleep now. Temple later.,3
Aang,"[  Alarmed.  ] Sokka! Wake up! [  Aang moves the stick up and down the sleeping bag, only touching Sokka with the tip of it.  ] There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!",3
Sokka,"[  He lazily opens one eye before yelling out in horror.  ] Ahh! [  He quickly rises and hops around, still inside the sleeping bag.  ] Get it off! Get it off! [  After two hops, Sokka slams flat to the ground.  ] Ahh!",3
Aang,[  Happily.  ] Great! You're awake! Let's go!,3
Zuko,"Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible. I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail.",3
Iroh,[  Disinterested.  ] You mean the Avatar?,3
Zuko,"[  Turns around sharply to face Iroh, as he slightly backs off.  ] Don't mention his name on these docks! [  Makes some wide arm movements.  ] Once word gets out that he's alive, every firebender will be out looking for him, and I don't want anyone getting in the way!",3
Zhao,"[  Iroh and Zuko turn, with shocked expressions on their face, toward the camera in the direction the sound came from.  ] Getting in the way of what, [  Close-up of a man with big sideburns dressed in a Fire Nation uniform.  ] Prince Zuko?",3
Zuko,[  With dislike in his voice.  ] Captain Zhao.,3
Zhao,[  Smirks.  ] It's  commander  now. And [  Bows slightly in Iroh's direction.  ] General Iroh. Great hero of our nation.,3
Iroh,[  Bows back.  ]  Retired  general.,3
Zhao,The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests anytime. What brings you to my harbor?,3
Iroh,Our ship is being repaired.,3
Zhao,That's quite a bit of damage.,3
Zuko,"Yes. [  He holds up one finger, while Iroh stares disinterested in front of him.  ] You wouldn't believe what happened. [  He glances at his uncle, and angrily commands him as he gestures at Zhao.  ] Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened.",3
Iroh,"[  Iroh's eyes open wide in surprise, as he is addressed by Zuko.  ] Yes. I will do that. [  He happily holds his hand up and relates enthusiastically.  ] It was incredible! [  To Zuko, from the corner of his mouth in a confused tone.  ] What? Did we crash or something?",3
Zuko,[  Looks at his uncle uncomfortably.  ] Yes! Right into ... an Earth Kingdom ship!,3
Zhao,[  In disbelief.  ] Really? You must regale me with all of the  thrilling  details. [  Smirks while he gets into Zuko's face.  ] Join me for a drink?,3
Zuko,"[  He averts his gaze and begins to walk away.  ] Sorry, but we have to go.",3
Iroh,"Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect. [  Removes his hand from Zuko's shoulder as he faces Zhao while Zuko just slants his eyes.  ] We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite.",3
Sokka,"[  Annoyed.  ] Hey, stomach? Be quiet, all right? I'm  trying  to find us some food.",3
Sokka,[  Accusingly to the two in front of him.  ] Hey! Who ate all of my blubbered seal jerky?!,3
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] Oh. That was food? [  Happily.  ] I used it to start the campfire last night. [  The hint of a smile can be heard.  ] Sorry.,3
Sokka,[  Shocked.  ] You  what  ?! [  Looks up before slanting his eyes and groans. Longing.  ] No wonder the flames smelled so good.,3
Aang,[  Excitedly.  ] The Patola Mountain range! We're almost there!,3
Katara,"[  Uneasily.  ] Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders.",3
Aang,[  Cheerfully.  ] What about 'em?,3
Katara,"[  Close-up of Katara.  ] Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless. [  Sadly.  ] They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people.",3
Aang,"[  Ponders over her words for a bit. Hopefully.  ] Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. They probably escaped!",3
Katara,[  Places one hand on Aang's shoulder.  ] I know it's hard to accept.,3
Aang,"[  Cheerfully, as Katara moves her hand back to her side.  ] You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison! [  Caresses Appa's head.  ] Right, Appa?",3
Aang,Yip yip!,3
Aang,[  Voice-over.  ] There it is. The Southern Air Temple.,3
Katara,"Aang, it's amazing!",3
Aang,"[  To Appa.  ] We're home, buddy! We're home. [  His eyes squint a bit in happiness.  ]",3
Zhao,"... And by the year's end, the Earth Kingdom capital will be under our rule. [  Shift to a bird view of the tent, revealing Zuko, sitting at a table, and Iroh, standing in the corner, looking at some weapons that are placed against the wall. Zhao turns around.  ] The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war.",3
Zuko,"[  Close-up. Angrily.  ] If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool!",3
Zhao,"[  Pulls up alongside Zuko and smirks.  ] Two years at sea have done little to temper your tongue. So, how is your search for the Avatar going?",3
Iroh,"Eh.. My fault, entirely.",3
Zuko,[  Aggressively.  ] We haven't found him yet.,3
Zhao,"Did you really expect to? The Avatar  died  a hundred years ago. [  Close-up of Zuko, as he slants his eyes.  ] Along with the rest of the airbenders. [  Close-up of Zhao, whose face contorts in an evil expression.  ] Unless you have found some evidence that the Avatar is alive?",3
Zuko,[  Faces Zhao and responds very clearly.  ] No. [  Stares back in front of him.  ] Nothing.,3
Zhao,"[  With an expression of disbelief on his face, as he rises from his chair.  ] Prince Zuko, the Avatar is the only one who can stop the Fire Nation from winning this war. [  Leans in and faces Zuko.  ] If you have an  ounce  of loyalty left, you'll tell me what you found.",3
Zuko,"I haven't found [  Looks up at Zhao and his tone becomes slightly more aggressive.  ] anything. [  Close-up, as he continues on a softer tone, slightly mockingly.  ] It's like you said. The Avatar probably died a long time ago. [  Gets up.  ] Come on, Uncle, we're going.",3
Soldier,"Commander Zhao, we interrogated the crew as you instructed. They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody, [  Close-up of Zuko's head from behind.  ] but let him escape.",3
Zhao,"[  Smiling evilly.  ] Now remind me, [  Close-up of Zuko's face, as Zhao walks up to him and leans over to talk into Zuko's ear. Zuko slants his eyes.  ] how,  exactly  , was your ship damaged?",3
Sokka,So where do I get something to eat?,3
Katara,"[  Irritated.  ] You're lucky enough to be one of the  first  outsiders to  ever  visit an airbender temple, and all you can think about is food?",3
Sokka,"I'm just a simple guy, with simple needs.",3
Aang,"[  Excited.  ] So that's where my friends and I would play airball, [  The camera shifts to a shot of a stadium consisting of many tall poles.  ] and over there [  The camera pans to the right to reveal the trio again.  ] is where the bison would sleep, and ... [  Aang sighs.  ]",3
Katara,What's wrong?,3
Aang,"[  A bit saddened.  ] This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison. Now there's just a bunch of weeds. [  His eyes squint with sadness. The shot changes to a back view of Aang as he stands on the ledge; his clothes flutter in the wind, a dead tree at each side of him. In a sad tone.  ] I can't believe how much things have changed.",3
Sokka,"[  Cheerfully trying to distract Aang from his sadness.  ] So uh, this airball game. How do you play?",3
Aang,"[  Smiling broadly, he stretches out his arms above his head.  ] Aang, seven! [  He forms a Zero with his hands and makes a circular movement with his whole body.  ] Sokka, zero!",3
Sokka,"[  Painfully.  ] Making him feel better is putting  me  in a world of hurt. [  He erects himself, but before he gets up completely, his eyes widen when he sees something in front of him and he crawls to the front. The camera shifts to reveal an old Fire Nation helmet lying in the snow. It has been battered by the elements, and shows signs of cracks and burns. He looks up at his sister.  ] Katara, check this out.",3
Katara,Fire Nation.,3
Sokka,We should tell him.,3
Katara,[  Yelling.  ] Aang! There's something you need to see.,3
Aang,"[  Aang runs to them from the airball court, still playing with the hollow ball. Cheerfully.  ] Okay!",3
Aang,[  Happily runs up.  ] What is it?,3
Katara,[  Innocently holds her hands behind her back.  ] Uh ... Just a new waterbending move I learned.,3
Aang,"Nice one! But enough practicing, [  Excited as he turns around and start walking away.  ] we have a whole temple to see!",3
Sokka,"[  Brushes the last of the snow from his head and shoulders.  ] You know, you can't protect him forever.",3
Sokka,"[  Arms crossed; stern.  ] Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't.",3
Katara,"I can for Aang's sake. If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated.",3
Aang,"[  Happily.  ] Hey guys! [  The two look up and see Aang standing in front of a statue of a monk, turning around and pointing toward it.  ] I want you to meet somebody!",3
Sokka,Who's that?,3
Aang,[  Facing the statue again.  ] Monk Gyatso! The greatest airbender in the world. [  Scene switches to a frontal view of the statue as Aang turns around again toward the siblings while gesturing at the statue.  ] He taught me everything I know.,3
Gyatso,"But the true secret, is in the gooey center.",3
Aang,[  Distant.  ] Hmm ...,3
Gyatso,"[  With a calm, soothing and understanding voice.  ] My ancient cake-making technique isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, Aang?",3
Aang,"[  Downcast.  ] This whole Avatar thing, m-maybe the monks made a mistake.",3
Gyatso,"The only mistake they made was telling you before you turned sixteen, but we can't concern ourselves with what was. We must act on what is.",3
Aang,[  Voice-over.  ] But Gyatso? How do I know if I'm ready for this?,3
Gyatso,"[  Cut back to a close shot of Gyatso with Aang sitting on the ledge in the background.  ] Your questions will be answered when you're old enough to enter the air temple sanctuary. Inside, you will meet someone who will guide you on your journey.",3
Aang,[  Excited and curious.  ] Who is it?,3
Gyatso,"[  Cut back to the close shot of Gyatso with Aang in the background.  ] When you are ready, he will reveal himself to you. [  In the background, Aang, annoyed by this vague answer, grunts softly and looks up to the sky before cupping his face in his hands again. Monk Gyatso continues on a bright, happy tone.  ] Now, are you going to help me with these cakes, [  Close-up of Aang as he smiles lovingly at Gyatso.  ] or not?",3
Aang,[  Happily stands up.  ] All right.,3
Gyatso,One. [  The camera switches to a side-view as the duo conjures a small air ball.  ] Two. Three!,3
Gyatso,"[  Full admiration and love.  ] Your aim has improved greatly, [  Caressing Aang's head.  ] my young pupil.",3
Katara,[  Understandingly places a hand on his shoulder.  ] You must miss him.,3
Aang,[  Downcast.  ] Yeah. [  He walks away.  ],3
Katara,[  Curious.  ] Where are you going?,3
Aang,[  Switch to a shot from Katara's point of view. Aang is walking up some stairs that lead to a corridor behind the statue. He looks back while answering.  ] The air temple sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet.,3
Katara,"But Aang, no one could have survived in there for a hundred years.",3
Aang,[  Camera changes to show the trio looking up at the door. Hopeful.  ] It's not impossible. [  Opening his arms.  ] I survived in the iceberg for that long.,3
Katara,[  Touching her chin with a finger.  ] Good point.,3
Aang,"[  Close shot of Aang with Katara visible over his shoulder. He glances hopeful at her over his shoulder. Excited.  ] Katara, whoever's in there might help figure out this Avatar thing!",3
Sokka,"[  Appears in screen from behind Aang's back. Katara and Aang look surprised at him. Eagerly.  ] And whoever's in there might have [  Katara's look changes to one of annoyance. Close-up of Sokka's determined, anticipating face.  ] a medley of delicious [  He rubs his hands together and practically starts to drool over the thought.  ] cured meats!",3
Sokka,I don't suppose you have a key?,3
Aang,"[  Shot from over Sokka's shoulder.  ] The key, Sokka, is airbending.",3
Aang,"[  Cut to a front view of Aang, as he brings his hand besides his mouth.  ] Hello? [  Switch back to a shot from behind Sokka and Katara as Aang enters the sanctuary.  ] Anyone home?",3
Zhao,So a twelve-year-old boy bested you and your firebenders. [  Wider shot of the tent as Zhao stops pacing. Iroh can be seen sitting in a corner.  ] You're more pathetic than I thought.,3
Zuko,"[  Angrily.  ] I underestimated him  once  , but it will  not  happen again!",3
Zhao,"[  Frontal view with Zuko in the background. Aggressively.  ] No, it will not. Because you won't have a second chance.",3
Zuko,"[  Alarmed.  ] Commander Zhao, [  Closer shot of Zuko.  ] I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I -",3
Zhao,"[  Cut to a shot from over Zuko's shoulder as Zhao angrily turns around, spreading flames in an arc.  ] And you failed! [  He walks intimidatingly up to Zuko.  ] Capturing the Avatar is too important to leave in a teenager's hands. He's mine now.",3
Zhao,Keep them here.,3
Iroh,"[  Calmly with a hint of amusement in his voice.  ] More tea, please.",3
Sokka,[  Disappointed.  ] Statues? That's it? Where's the meat?,3
Katara,Who are all these people?,3
Aang,[  Pensive.  ] I'm not sure. [  Frontal view of Aang.  ] But it feels like I know them somehow. Look! [  Camera shifts to a point behind Aang and Katara. Aang points at the statue of a man with airbending mastery tattoos in front of him.  ] That one's an airbender.,3
Katara,"[  Camera pans to the right. Katara points at the statue of a male dressed in Water Tribe clothes next to the airbender.  ] And this one's a waterbender. [  Looks to the right and back to the left.  ] They're lined up in a pattern: [  Points at the respective statues.  ] air, water, earth and fire.",3
Aang,That's the Avatar Cycle.,3
Katara,"[  Understanding.  ] Of course. They're Avatars. All these people are your past lives, Aang.",3
Aang,Wow! There are so many!,3
Sokka,"[  Skeptically.  ] Past lives? [  Aang stops before a statue while Sokka and Katara are still visible in the background.  ] Katara, you really believe in that stuff?",3
Katara,"It's true. [  The picture pans up the reveal Aang staring at the statue of an elderly man with a beard. In the background hundreds of statues can be seen spiraling up.  ] When the Avatar dies, he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.",3
Katara,Aang! Snap out of it!,3
Aang,[  Dazed.  ] Huh?,3
Katara,[  She curiously follows his gaze and looks at the statue as well.  ] Who is that?,3
Aang,"That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me.",3
Sokka,You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.,3
Katara,[  Looks at the base of the statue.  ] There's no writing. How do you know his name?,3
Aang,I'm not sure. I just know it somehow.,3
Sokka,[  Growls irritably while crossing his arms.  ] You just couldn't get any weirder.,3
Sokka,[  Whispering.  ] Firebender. Nobody make a sound.,3
Katara,[  Irritably.  ] You're making a sound!,3
Aang and Sokka,[  Putting their finger before their mouths.  ] Shhhh!,3
Sokka,[  Whispering.  ] That firebender won't know what hit him.,3
Aang,[  Excitedly.  ] Lemur!,3
Sokka,[  Quickly pans to a drooling Sokka.  ] Dinner!,3
Aang,[  Reassuring.  ] Don't listen to him. You're going to be my new pet.,3
Sokka,"[  Aang glares angrily at Sokka, before the scene switches to a close-up of his drooling face. Challenging.  ] Not if I get him first!",3
Aang,Wait! Come back!,3
Sokka,I want to eat you!,3
Sokka,Hey! No fair!,3
Zhao,"My search party is ready. Once I'm out to sea, [  Cut to a shot from over Zhao's head to reveal Iroh and Zuko sitting in two chairs in front of him in the middle of the tent.  ] my guards will escort you back to your ship and [  Close-up of Zuko, who angrily looks down.  ] you'll be free to go.",3
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] Why? Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?,3
Zhao,[  Amused.  ] You? Stop me? Impossible.,3
Zuko,"[  Angrily gets up. Enraged.  ] Don't underestimate me, Zhao! I will capture the Avatar before you!",3
Iroh,"[  Gets up as well; sternly.  ] Prince Zuko, that's enough.",3
Zhao,"[  Confidently.  ] You can't compete with me. I have hundreds of war ships under my command and you? You're just a banished prince. No home, no allies. Your own father doesn't even want you.",3
Zuko,"[  Angrily.  ] You're wrong! Once I deliver the Avatar to my father, he will welcome me home with honor, and restore my rightful place on the throne!",3
Zhao,"[  Close-up of Zhao, as the camera pans to the right to slowly reveal his whole face.  ] If your father really wanted you home, he would have let you return by now, Avatar or no Avatar. But in his eyes you are a failure and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.",3
Zuko,[  Cut to Zuko.  ] That's not true.,3
Zhao,You have the scar to prove it.,3
Zuko,[  Furiously.  ] Maybe you'd like one to match!,3
Zhao,[  Slightly mockingly.  ] Is that a challenge?,3
Zuko,An Agni Kai. At sunset.,3
Zhao,Very well. [  Zhao erects himself.  ] It's a shame your father won't be here to watch me humiliate you. [  Turns around.  ] I guess your uncle will do.,3
Iroh,"[  Camera pans slowly to the right to a full close-up of Zuko. Worried.  ] Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?",3
Zuko,[  Darkly.  ] I will never forget.,3
Aang,"[  Follows the lemur.  ] Hey! Come back! [  Cut to a shot from inside the tent, as Aang pushes the decaying curtain of drapes out of the way. Happily looks around.  ] Come on out, little lemur! That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.",3
Aang,[  Shocked.  ] Firebenders? They were here?,3
Aang,[  Devastated.  ] Gyatso.,3
Sokka,"[  Happily.  ] Hey, Aang! You find my dinner yet? [  Cut to a side-view of Aang sitting on his knees, his head cupped in his hands. Sokka walks toward him. Reassuring.  ] Aang, I wasn't  really  going to eat the lemur, okay? [  He approaches Aang with a smile on his face, but shakes his head and does a double take.  ] Oh, man. [  Switch to a shot of the skeleton of the monk, which slowly moves back to reveal that Sokka places a hand on Aang's shoulder.  ] Come on, Aang. Everything will be all right. Let's get out of here.",3
Katara,[  Worried.  ] Aang!,3
Fire Sage,Send word to the Fire Lord immediately! The Avatar has returned!,3
Sokka,[  Alarmed.  ] Aang! Come on! Snap out of it!,3
Sokka,Aaaaahh!,3
Katara,[  Shouting above the raging winds. Close-up of the two siblings. Katara looks worried at her brother.  ] What happened?,3
Sokka,[  Shouting.  ] He found out firebenders killed Gyatso!,3
Katara,Oh no! It's his Avatar Spirit! [  Raises her hand to protect herself against the winds and the flying debris.  ] He must have triggered it! I'm going to try and calm him down! [  Closes an eye against the wind and starts to make her way toward Aang.  ],3
Sokka,"[  Holds on to the rock in an attempt to keep from being blown away. Alarmed.  ] Well, do it! Before he blows us off the mountain!",3
Iroh,"Remember your firebending basics, [  Close-up of Iroh's upper body.  ] Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.",3
Zuko,[  Close-up of Zuko's determined face.  ] I refuse to let him win.,3
Zhao,[  Confident whisper.  ] This will be over quickly.,3
Iroh,"Basics, Zuko! [  Close-up of Zuko's determined face.  ] Break his root!",3
Zhao,[  Challenging.  ] Do it!,3
Zhao,That's it? Your father raised a coward.,3
Zuko,"[  Anger clearly audible in his voice.  ] Next time you get in my way, I promise, I won't hold back.",3
Iroh,"No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory. [  Turns to face Zhao. Condescending.  ] So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat? [  Close-up of Zhao lying on the floor.  ] Disgraceful. [  Cut back to a closer shot of Zuko and Iroh.  ] Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you. [  Zuko looks at Iroh upon hearing those last words. Switch to a shot from over Zhao's shoulders.  ] Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious.",3
Zuko,"[  Softly.  ] Did you really mean that, Uncle?",3
Iroh,"[  Smiling slyly, while glancing at his nephew.  ] Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.",3
Katara,"[  In the background, Sokka is hunched over his rock, clenching his teeth together. Katara shouts calmly with a sad expression on her face. The camera slowly moves in on her.  ] Aang! I know you're upset and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom. [  Diverts her eyes. Shot switches to a frontal view of Aang, his tattoos glowing and wind swirling around him; his clothes flutter in the storm. Sokka runs over to his sister in the background.  ] Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, [  Close-up of her as she looks up at him.  ] but you still have a family. Sokka and I! [  Sokka opens his eyes and glances at his sister.  ] We're your family now!",3
Sokka,[  Gently.  ] Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise.,3
Aang,[  Sad and tired.  ] I'm sorry.,3
Katara,It's okay. It wasn't your fault.,3
Aang,"[  Sadly.  ] But you were right. And if the firebenders found this temple, that means they found the other ones, too. [  Close-up of his sad face, as he closes his eyes.  ] I really am the last airbender.",3
Katara,Everything's packed. You ready to go?,3
Aang,[  Closer shot of Aang and Katara's faces. Softly.  ] How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?,3
Katara,Maybe you'll find a way.,3
Aang,Looks like you made a new friend Sokka!,3
Sokka,[  Pushing the food in his mouth with his two hands. Looks up with an exhilarated look upon his face. With a full mouth.  ] Can't talk! Must eat! [  Takes another big bite.  ],3
Aang,"[  Looking at the lemur from the corners of his eye.  ] Hey, little guy!",3
Aang,"[  To the winged-lemur.  ] You, me and Appa; [  Frontal view as the camera closes in on them.  ] we're all that's left of this place. [  Looks at the lemur.  ] We have to stick together. Katara, Sokka, [  Switches to a shot of the duo fiddling with their luggage. They turn back to look at Aang as he calls them. Sokka is still eating a peach.  ] say hello to the newest member of our family.",3
Katara,[  Aang approaches the duo.  ] What are you going to name him?,3
Aang,Momo.,3
Zuko,"[  Calmly.  ] The only reason you should be interrupting me, is if you have news about the Avatar.",4
Iroh,"[  Pushes open the door completely and enters the room, holding a rolled up scroll in his hands.  ] Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset.",4
Zuko,"[  Cut to shot of the prince sitting motionless, still assuming his meditative stance, his back to the camera. Calmly.  ] Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now, whatever you have to say, I'm sure I can take it.",4
Iroh,"[  Frontal view of Zuko, Iroh tugging his small beard in the background.  ] Okay then. [  Hesitatingly.  ] We have no idea where he is.",4
Zuko,[  Enraged.  ] What!?,4
Iroh,You really should open a window in here.,4
Zuko,"[  He snatches the scroll from Iroh's hand.  ] Give me the map! [  He unrolls it, scanning over the parchment.  ]",4
Iroh,"Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down.",4
Zuko,"[  Desperately.  ] How am I going to find him, Uncle? [  Cut to a shot of the map in Zuko's hand, several locations marked down with zigzagged lines connecting each point; Voice-over.  ] He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering.",4
Sokka,"[  To Aang.  ] You have no idea where you're going, do you?",4
Aang,Well ... [  Happily.  ] I know it's near water.,4
Sokka,[  Sarcastically.  ] I guess we're getting close then.,4
Aang,"Momo, marbles please. [  Close-up of Momo who dives into his shirt and emerges, handing Aang two small, gray marbles.  ] Hey Katara, check out this airbending trick!",4
Katara,"[  Nonchalantly, still focusing on her task at hand.  ] That's great, Aang.",4
Aang,"[  Disappointed, stops performing the trick.  ] You didn't even look.",4
Katara,[  Looks over Aang and attempts to show enthusiasm.  ] That's great!,4
Aang,[  Dismayed.  ] But I'm not doing it now.,4
Sokka,"[  Cut to shot of Katara and Sokka seated on Appa's saddle. Sokka waves his arm breezily at Aang as if he is trying to shoo him away.  ] Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.",4
Katara,[  Close side-view shot of Katara as she casts her brother an annoyed glare; irritably.  ] What does me being a  girl  have to do with sewing?,4
Sokka,[  Cut to a shot of Sokka lazily resting with his arms behind his head.  ] Simple. Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. [  Cut back to an annoyed Katara.  ] It's just the natural order of things.,4
Katara,[  Suddenly smiles. Sarcastically.  ] All done with your pants! [  Shows that the pants are still ripped.  ] And look what a great job I did!,4
Sokka,"[  Protesting and pleading.  ] Wait! I was just kidding. [  Sticks one arm through the large hole in his pants.  ] I can't wear these! Katara, please!",4
Aang,"[  Cut to a frontal view of Aang with the duo in the background. Enthusiastically.  ] Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants.",4
Sokka,We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?,4
Katara,"[  Cut to close frontal view of Aang who is looking at something, his hand held against his brow. The siblings stand in the background.  ] He's right. At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring.",4
Aang,"[  Camera moves back to reveal Appa as well. Innocently.  ] But Appa's tired, aren't you boy?",4
Aang,"[  Nudges Appa against his front leg with his elbow.  ] I  said,  aren't you boy?",4
Sokka,"[  Aang smiles over his shoulder at the duo. Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, that was  real  convincing.[  Somewhat fearfully.  ] Still, hard to argue with a ten-ton magical monster.",4
Aang,"[  Runs toward the shore, takes a sharp breath and points. Excitedly.  ] Look!",4
Aang,"[  Excited.  ] That's why we're here. [  Starts to disrobe while more koi fish jump out of the water in the background.  ] Elephant koi, and I'm gonna ride it. Katara, you've got to watch me!",4
Aang,Cold!,4
Aang,"[  Switch to a close-up of Aang atop the fish's back, waving at his friends.  ] Hahaha, hahaha!",4
Katara,[  Cut to Katara who enthusiastically waves back.  ] Whooh!,4
Katara,[  Smiling.  ] He looks pretty good out there.,4
Sokka,[  Unimpressed.  ] Are you kidding? [  Lazily gestures at Aang in the water.  ] The fish is doing all the work.,4
Katara,"[  Notices something behind Sokka and runs off screen.  ] No, Appa. Don't eat that! [  Appa grunts.  ]",4
Aang,"[  Disappointed, the smile having faded off his face.  ] Oh man ...",4
Sokka,[  Alarmed.  ] There's something in the water!,4
Katara,[  Worried.  ] What's wrong?,4
Sokka,Aang's in trouble. Aang!,4
Katara,Get out of there!,4
Sokka,"Get back here, Aang!",4
Aang,[  Flailing his arms and legs.  ] Whaaaahh! Aaaah!,4
Aang,[  Frightened.  ] Whaaaahh!,4
Katara,What was that thing?,4
Aang,I don't know.,4
Sokka,"[  Stands up and wipes his hands together.  ] Well, let's not stick around to find out. Time to hit the road.",4
Sokka,"Or, we could stay a while.",4
Oyaji,[  Voice-over.  ] You three have some explaining to do.,4
Suki,"[  Voice-over.  ] And if you don't answer all our questions, we're throwing you back in the water with the Unagi.",4
Sokka,"[  Close-up of the blindfolded Sokka. Challenging.  ] Show yourselves, cowards!",4
Sokka,[  Aggressively.  ] Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?,4
Suki,"[  Stepping forward, gesturing heavily with her clenched fist. Indignantly.  ] There were no men. We ambushed you. Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?",4
Sokka,"[  Closer side-view shot of Sokka who stares at them in disbelief.  ] Wait a second, [  He amusingly glance to his right to where Aang stands as if he is looking for confirmation. Mockingly.  ] there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.",4
Suki,"[  Grabs Sokka by his collar. Angrily.  ] A bunch of girls, huh? The Unagi's gonna eat well tonight.",4
Katara,"[  Leans forward in her bonds. Pleading and apologetically.  ] No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes. [  Suki released Sokka, but still stares at him in dismay.  ]",4
Aang,It's my fault. [  The three teenagers looks surprised at Aang's words. The camera pans the left to reveal a sorrowfully looking Aang.  ] I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.,4
Oyaji,[  Cut to a frontal view of Oyaji. Angrily.  ] How do we know you're not [  Points at the bound three.  ] Fire Nation spies? Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!,4
Aang,"[  Cut back to Aang, a brightened expression on his face.  ] This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!",4
Oyaji,[  Humorless.  ] Ha! How could you possibly know her?,4
Oyaji,"Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago. [  Close-up of the face of the statue. The colors have faded away a bit, but it is still clear that Kyoshi wears the same white face paint, with the red accentuated eyes as the modern Kyoshi Warriors wear.  ] She's been dead for centuries.",4
Aang,"[  Cut to Aang who looks pensive at the statue before looking at the ground in front of him. He speaks in a soft, calm voice while the camera slowly zooms in on him.  ] I know her because I'm the Avatar.",4
Suki,[  Not convinced by Aang's statement. Shaking her fist to emphasize her words.  ] That's impossible! The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.,4
Aang,[  Cut to Aang and his friend from a point of view between Suki and Oyaji. Aang smiles sheepishly.  ] That's me!,4
Oyaji,[  Cut to frontal view of Suki and Oyaji who angrily points at Aang while looking at Suki.  ] Throw the impostor to the Unagi!,4
Katara,[  Nervously.  ] Aang ... do some airbending.,4
Spectators,[  Talking all at once.  ] Wow! Did you see that? Airbender!,4
Oyaji,[  In awe.  ] It's true ... you  are  the Avatar!,4
Aang,"[  Cut to a frontal view of Aang with a serious look on his face, a relieved Sokka and Katara still tied up in the background to his left.  ] Now ... [  He pulls his marbles out from underneath his robes.  ] check this out!",4
Little girl,[  Excited.  ] Did you hear the news? [  The fisherman picks up his basket.  ] The Avatar's on Kyoshi!,4
Fisherman,"[  Due to his utter surprise, he drops his basket.  ] Huh?",4
Zuko,"[  Yells on a demanding tone.  ] The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island? [  Cut to a frontal shot of Iroh as Zuko addresses him while leaving the room. Iroh looks at Zuko as he walks away.  ] Uncle, ready the rhinos. He's not getting away from me this time.",4
Iroh,[  Casually points at the smoking fish in front of him.  ] Are you going to finish that?,4
Zuko,[  Turns around and snatches the plate off the table. Aggressively.  ] I was going to save it for later!,4
Aang,[  Throws his arms in the air while Momo digs in and chitters. Ecstatic.  ] All right! Dessert for breakfast!,4
Aang,These people sure know [  The rest is kind of muffled out because he is cramming his desserts in his mouth.  ] how to treat an Avatar!,4
Aang,[  Impressed.  ] Mmm ... [  Offers one of the desserts he is holding to Katara.  ] Katara you've got to try these!,4
Katara,"[  Puts down the orange dessert, accepts the dessert Aang offers her and takes a bit.  ] Well, maybe just a bite.",4
Aang,"Sokka, what's your problem?  Eat!",4
Sokka,Not hungry.,4
Aang,[  Aang leans backward to be able to look past Katara to Sokka; his eyes wide open in surprise.  ] But you're always hungry!,4
Katara,[  Glancing amusingly at Aang. Slightly mocking.  ] He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.,4
Sokka,[  Protesting.  ] They snuck up on me!,4
Katara,[  Mockingly looks at her brother.  ] Right. And  then  they kicked your butt.,4
Sokka,[  Indignant.  ] Sneak attacks don't count! [  Walks out of the scene with big strides. Mumbling to himself.  ] Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. [  Comes back to the table to face Katara and Aang. Momo grabs some more pastries that lie around him.  ] I'm not scared of any girls. [  Snatches some of the desert of the table.  ] Who do they think they are anyway? [  He shoves one of the deserts in his mouth and stalks off again.  ] Mmm ... this is tasty.,4
Aang,What's he so angry about? [  Excited.  ] It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment!,4
Katara,"Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.",4
Aang,"[  Lowers his arm with the pastry and offers it to Momo's grasping paw.  ] I'm sure we'll be fine. [  The lemur feels the desert and quickly snatches it out of Aang's hand.  ] Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town? [  Aang moves closer to Katara and turns around to look out of the window at the statue.  ] They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!",4
Katara,"Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. [  Slightly concerned.  ] I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.",4
Aang,"[  Reassuring.  ] Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.",4
Painter,"[  Muttering to himself.  ] Hmmm ... Painting the Avatar ... that's easy enough ... [  He lowers the canvas and notices that another girl has pulled up next to Aang. Surprised.  ] Oh, there's another one ... [  He obscures his models again from sight by raising his canvas and painting the outlines of the other girl.  ] Well, I'll make an adjustment here, and ... [  He lowers the canvas to see that three more girls have joined Aang.  ] There's more ... [  He obscures the Avatar and his fangirls from sight again with his canvas while he quickly paints Aang.  ] well that ...",4
Sokka,[  Angrily grunting to himself.  ] I can't believe I got beat up by a bunch of girls.,4
Sokka,"[  Condescending.  ] Sorry ladies, [  Suki and the other warriors stop their exercise and close their fans. They stare at Sokka with a serious look on their faces.  ] didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson. [  The camera moves back, revealing that Sokka was stretching.  ] I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?",4
Suki,"[  Looks at how Sokka continues his warm up.  ] Well, you're in the right place. [  Cut to a side-view while Sokka is loosening up his hips.  ] Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar.",4
Sokka,"[  Stretching his arms.  ] It's all right. [  Mockingly suppressing a laugh while speaking.  ] I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception.",4
Suki,[  Sarcastically.  ] I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.,4
Sokka,"[  Smugly.  ] True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village.",4
Suki,"[  Keeps using sarcasm without Sokka catching on to it. Leans slightly toward Sokka.  ] Wow! Best warrior, huh? [  Glances back to the other Kyoshi Warriors.  ] In your whole village? [  Looks back to Sokka.  ] Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration.",4
Sokka,[  Frontal view of Sokka as his eyes widen upon hearing the unexpected request.  ] Oh ... Well ... I mean ... I ...,4
Suki,"[  Turns to the other warriors.  ] Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?",4
Sokka,"Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to. [  He places his hands on Suki's shoulder in order to push her back a little, but she does not move a bit.  ] All right, you stand over there. Now, this may be a little tough, but try to block me.",4
Sokka,"[  Rubbing his hurt right shoulder. Impressed.  ] Aw! Heh heh ... Good. Of course, I was going easy on you.",4
Suki,[  Close-up of Suki's confident face.  ] Of course.,4
Sokka,"[  He starts with a mumble, raising his tone of voice with each word.  ] Let's see if you can [  Shouting while he attempts to hit Suki with a roundhouse kick.  ] handle  this  !",4
Sokka,[  His voice cracking in anger.  ] That does it!,4
Suki,[  Mockingly.  ] Anything else you want to teach us?,4
Aang,"There she is, girls. Me in a past life.",4
Fangirls,Ooohhh ...,4
Koko,[  Admiringly.  ] You were pretty!,4
Aang,"[  Holding up a finger to draw their attention.  ] Excuse me for a second, ladies.",4
Katara,"[  Turns around in surprise, but is happy to see that the poke came from Aang.  ] Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? [  She moves the pot toward Aang.  ] It's a little heavy.",4
Aang,"[  Holding up his hands to fob off with the offered pot.  ] Actually, I can't right now.",4
Katara,"[  Slightly irritated.  ] What do you mean, ""you can't?""",4
Aang,I promised the girls I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun!,4
Katara,[  Resumed filling the pot with more vegetables.  ] Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does  not  sound like fun.,4
Aang,"[  Disappointed.  ] Well, neither does carrying your basket.",4
Katara,"[  Annoyed.  ] It's not  my  basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon.",4
Aang,"[  Central focus on Aang.  ] I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet. I can't put my finger on it, [  He puts his hand to his chin in a thinking posture; the camera pans to the right, showing Aang's fangirls better in the background.  ] but there's something I really like about this place.",4
Koko,"[  Stomping her foot in annoyance and puts her hands on her hips, while another girl happily waves at Aang; irritated.  ] What's taking you so long, Aangy?",4
Katara,[  Slightly mocking.  ] Aangy ...,4
Aang,"[  Enthusiastically.  ] Just a second, Koko!",4
Katara,"[  Sarcastic.  ] ""Simple monk"", huh? [  Annoyed.  ] I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.",4
Aang,It didn't. You know what I think? You just don't want to come because you're  jealous.,4
Katara,[  Close-up; angrily.  ]  Jealous  ? [  More high pitched voice.  ] Of what?,4
Aang,Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.,4
Katara,[  Irritated.  ] That's ridiculous.,4
Aang,"It  is  a little ridiculous, but I understand.",4
Katara,[  Turning away; irritated.  ] Urch!,4
Sokka,"[  Timidly.  ] Uh ... Hey, Suki.",4
Suki,[  Hostile.  ] Hoping for another dance lesson?,4
Sokka,"[  Cut to a shot of Sokka who does not know how to act.  ] No ... I ... well, let me explain.",4
Suki,[  Close-up of Suki; hostile.  ] Spit it out! What do you want?,4
Sokka,[  Sokka looks hurt at Suki's hostility. He humbly drops to his knees in front of her.  ] I would be honored if you would teach me.,4
Suki,[  Frog view of Suki; hostile.  ] Even if I'm a  girl  ?,4
Sokka,[  Averting his eyes.  ] I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was ... wrong.,4
Suki,"[  Cut to a side-view of the two; Suki has her arms crossed while looking down upon Sokka.  ] We normally don't teach outsiders, let alone boys.",4
Sokka,[  Raises his head to face her; pleading.  ] Please make an exception. [  Bowing again.  ] I won't let you down.,4
Suki,[  Frog view; on a friendlier tone.  ] All right. But you have to follow all of our traditions.,4
Sokka,[  Close-up; eagerly.  ] Of course!,4
Suki,[  Smiling.  ] And I mean  all  of them.,4
Sokka,[  Embarrassed looking down at his wardrobe.  ] Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little ... [  Lower his arms in defeat.  ] girly.,4
Suki,"It's a warrior's uniform, you should be proud. [  Closeup of Sokka, the camera pans down to reveal the entire uniform close by.  ] The silk threads symbolize the brave blood that flows through our veins. The gold insignia represents the honor of the warrior's heart.",4
Sokka,[  Proudly.  ] Bravery and honor.,4
Aang,[  Popping in; smiling broadly.  ] Hey Sokka! [  Sokka winces upon hearing his name and slants his eyes and shoulders in embarrassment.  ] Nice dress!,4
Aang,"[  Confidently.  ] Katara, remember how Unagi almost got me yesterday?",4
Katara,"[  Slants up her eyes in annoyance, which Aang can't see while continuing to practice her bending.  ] Yeah.",4
Aang,"[  Bragging.  ] Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be  real  dangerous.",4
Katara,[  Still not looking at Aang; disinterested.  ] Good for you.,4
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] You're not going to stop me?,4
Katara,[  Still disinterested.  ] Nope. Have fun.,4
Aang,[  Crossing his arms; defiant.  ] I will.,4
Katara,[  Growing irritated again.  ] Great.,4
Aang,[  Annoyed at Katara's lack of interest.  ] I know it's great.,4
Katara,[  Irritated.  ] I'm glad you know.,4
Aang,[  Annoyed.  ] I'm glad you're glad.,4
Katara,[  Angry.  ] Good! [  She loses control over the water and it splashed back into the bowl. Katara balls her fists in annoyance.  ],4
Aang,[  Emphasizing his reacting by swinging his hands.  ] Fine!,4
Suki,You're not going to master it in one day. Even I'm not that good.,4
Sokka,I think I'm starting to get it.,4
Sokka,Tah!,4
Suki,"[  Peeks her head around the door to look at the hit tree before turning back to Sokka. Friendly.  ] It's not about strength. Our technique is about using your opponents' force against them. Loosen up. [  Retracts her own fan from her belt and points it at Sokka, who takes on a battle position.  ] Think of the fan as an extension of your arm. [  Close-up of Sokka.  ] Wait for an opening and then ...",4
Sokka,"[  Looks surprised, quickly crosses his arms and looks smug.  ] Hmm ...",4
Suki,[  Quickly gets up; irritated.  ] I fell on purpose to make you  feel  better!,4
Sokka,"[  Points at Suki, exclaims ecstaticly.  ] I got you! Admit I got you!",4
Suki,"Okay, it was a lucky shot. [  Releases the finger while smiling broadly. On a more serious tone.  ] Let's see if you can do it again.",4
Koko,[  Resting her head on her hand. Bored and impatiently.  ] What's taking so long?,4
Aang,[  Close-up; reassuring.  ] I'm sure it will be here any second! [  Looking for a way to entertain the girls.  ] What about this?,4
Little Girl,[  Annoyed.  ] Not that again  . Boring  !,4
Koko,[  The girls stand up. Waving her arms to emphasize her question.  ] Where's Unagi? It's getting late.,4
Aang,[  Waving from the water to the girls. Pleading.  ] Where're you going? Don't leave!,4
Koko,"[  Holds her hands to her mouth to emphasize her yelling.  ] Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time.",4
Aang,[  Happily.  ] Katara! You showed up!,4
Katara,[  Somewhat concerned.  ] I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried.,4
Aang,Back there you acted like you didn't care.,4
Katara,[  In a regretful voice.  ] I'm sorry.,4
Aang,[  Lowering his eyes.  ] Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.,4
Katara,"[  Smiling. Puts her hands beside her mouth, yelling in a joking manner.  ] Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!",4
Aang,[  Smiling broadly and starts to swing toward the shore.  ] On my way!,4
Katara,"[  Worried.  ] Hang on, Aang!",4
Katara,Aang!,4
Katara,[  Carefully peeking over the rock.  ] Zuko!,4
Zuko,I want the Avatar  alive.,4
Katara,"[  Worriedly.  ] Wake up, Aang!",4
Aang,[  Coughing out the last of the water. In a weak voice.  ] Katara ... [  Katara lovingly smiles at him with relief written all over her face.  ] don't ride Unagi. Not fun.,4
Suki,[  Smiling while impressed.  ] Not bad.,4
Oyaji,"[  Sokka and Suki worriedly turn to him. Alarmed.  ] Firebenders have landed on our shores! [  Suki immediately runs to him while he turns to head back to the town.  ] Girls, come quickly!",4
Sokka,"[  Protesting.  ] Hey, I'm not a ... [  Momo jumps on his shoulder and pushes himself off toward the door. Conceding.  ] oh, whatever!",4
Zuko,"[  Frog view close-up.  ] Come out, Avatar! [  Camera pans from left to right, revealing how several villagers are hiding in the nearby houses.  ] You can't hide from me forever! [  Camera focuses on the four riders while moving away from them over the main street, showing that there is not any movement in the village. Side-view of Zuko.  ] Find him.",4
Sokka,I guess training's over.,4
Zuko,"Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you.",4
Aang,[  Close-up of Zuko.  ] Hey! Over here!,4
Zuko,Finally!,4
Katara,Get inside.,4
Aang,[  Sorrowful.  ] Look what I brought to this place.,4
Katara,It's not your fault.,4
Aang,"[  Close-up. Upset.  ] Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me.",4
Katara,"Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.",4
Aang,[  Sad.  ] I'll call Appa.,4
Suki,There's no time to say goodbye.,4
Sokka,"What about, ""I'm sorry?""",4
Suki,[  Surprised.  ] For what?,4
Sokka,[  Close-up. Regretful.  ] I treated you like a girl when I should've treated you like a warrior.,4
Suki,"[  Side-view.  ] I  am  a warrior. [  She leans over and kisses Sokka on the cheek, before continuing again. A surprised Sokka touches his cheek where Suki just kissed him.  ] But I'm a girl, too. [  Cut to shot of Sokka who blushes; cut to Suki who stands in the alleyway, her fan slid open to fight.  ] Now get out of here! We'll hold them off.",4
Aang,"[  Pulling the reins.  ] Appa, yip yip!",4
Zuko,Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!,4
Katara,"[  Peeking over the rim of the saddle to address a saddened Aang. Sokka is wiping of the face paint with his sleeve.  ] I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. [  Gesturing toward the town.  ] Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. [  Comforting.  ] They're going to be okay, Aang.",4
Katara,[  Shocked; off-camera.  ] What are you doing?,4
Oyaji,"[  Gratefully smiling.  ] Thank you, Avatar.",4
Aang,"[  Side-view of Aang mounting Appa's saddle.  ] I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous.",4
Katara,"[  Smiling as Aang sits down.  ] Yes, it was.",4
Aang,The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu! [  Camera pans up from the group to show the entire pyramid structured city of Omashu. Close-up of an excited Aang.  ] I used to always come here to visit my friend Bumi.,5
Katara,[  Close-up; impressed.  ] Wow. We don't have buildings like this in the South Pole!,5
Sokka,[  Close-up; overwhelmed.  ] They have buildings here that don't melt!,5
Aang,"[  Back view of the siblings, with Aang and the city visible between them. Excitedly.  ] Well let's go, slow pokes. The real fun's inside the city!",5
Katara,"[  Stretching her arm out to him, halting Aang with her cry.  ] Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.",5
Sokka,[  Somewhat seriously.  ] You need a disguise.,5
Aang,[  Shot of Aang looking up.  ] So what am I supposed to do? [  In a slightly sarcastic tone.  ] Grow a mustache?,5
Aang,[  Scratching underneath the wig.  ] Ugh. This is so itchy. [  Cut to a broader shot; Aang is standing beside Appa. To Appa.  ] How do you live in this stuff?,5
Sokka,Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.,5
Katara,"[  Glancing at Sokka.  ] Technically, Aang is 112 years old.",5
Aang,"[  In an old man's voice.  ] Now let's get to skippin', young whipper-snappers. The big city awaits!",5
Aang,You guys are going to love Omashu. [  Cut to front view shot as the three friends walk toward the gate. Aang looks over his shoulder at Sokka.  ] The people here are the friendliest in the world.,5
Gate guard,[  Angrily.  ] Rotten cabbages?! [  Far off shot of three guards and a cabbage merchant with his cart in front of the closed gate of Omashu; harshly.  ] What kind of slum do you think this is?!,5
Cabbage merchant,[  Leaning over the rim of the path. Dramatically waving his arms in despair.  ] No! My cabbages!,5
Aang,"[  Close-up, broadly smiling; somewhat nervously.  ] Just keep smiling!",5
Gate guard,[  Aggressively with a glare.  ] State your business!,5
Aang,"[  In old man voice, poking the chest of the sentry.  ] My business is my business, young man, [  Shot of the boulder crashing down due to the guards lack of concentration beside Katara and Sokka as they jump up slightly from the impact; close-up of Aang pointing a finger at the camera.  ] and none of yours! [  Close-up of the guard, taken aback by the threateningly pointing finger just centimeters from his face.  ] I've got half a mind to [  Close-up of Sokka, eyes and mouth wide open in shock at Aang's audacity to talk to the sentry like that, and Katara, shaking her head with eyes wide open in shock.  ] bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!",5
Gate guard,"[  In a calmer voice.  ] Settle down, old timer! Just tell me who you are.",5
Aang,"[  Sokka and Katara are still in shock in the background; in old man voice.  ] Name's Bonzu Pippinpaddleopsicopolis, the Third, [  Sokka raises a questioningly eyebrow while Katara walks up, smiling friendly.  ] and these are my grandkids.",5
Katara,[  Waving.  ] Hi. June Pippinpaddleopsicopolis. Nice to meet you.,5
Gate guard,"[  Pensively rubbing his beard, while eying the two children before him. Pointing at Katara.  ]  You  seem like a responsible young lady. See that your grandfather stays out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!",5
Katara,[  Lightheartedly.  ] We will!,5
Gate guard,"[  Eying Sokka as he passes.  ] Wait a minute! [  Close-up of Sokka as he halts, eyes widening in fear as the guard grasps his shoulder. Aang and Katara turn around to see what the holdup is. The guard turns Sokka around; sternly.  ] You're a strong young boy! Show some respect for the elderly and carry your grandfather's bag!",5
Aang,[  In old man voice.  ] Good idea!,5
Aang,[  Back to regular voice; voice-over.  ] This is the Omashu delivery system. [  Camera shows the top of the city.  ] Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.,5
Aang,"[  Voice-over.  ] Earthbending brings the packages up, and gravity brings them down.",5
Sokka,"[  Cut back to the trio; unimpressed.  ] Great, so they get their mail on time.",5
Aang,"[  Excitedly.  ] They do get their mail on time, [  Close-up of Aang.  ] but my friend Bumi found [  Squints eyes mischievously.  ] a better use for these chutes.",5
Bumi,[  Excitedly.  ] Look around you! What do you see?,5
Aang,[  Unsurely.  ] Um ... The mail system?,5
Bumi,"[  Pointing his finger in the air and waving it around while Aang walks up to him.  ] Instead of seeing what they want you to see, [  Leaning toward Aang.  ] you got to open your brain to the possibilities.",5
Aang,[  Uncomprehending.  ] A package-sending system?,5
Bumi,[  Excitedly; camera moves back to show the start of one of the chutes.  ] The world's greatest superslide!,5
Aang,"[  Close-up of a crazed smiling Bumi, and a broadly smiling Aang.  ] Bumi, you're a mad genius!",5
Aang,"[  Raising one finger to emphasize his words; the cart rocking back and forth, creaking.  ] One ride. Then we're off to the North Pole. Airbender's honor.",5
Katara,"[  Uneasy.  ] It sounded like fun at first, [  Shot switches to a bird's eye view, fully revealing the steepness of the chute.  ] but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second [  Aang leans forward, tipping the balance of the box, sending it down the slope at a tremendous speed, making Katara scream out her last word.  ] th-o-o-oughts!",5
Aang,[  Excitedly.  ] I'm on it!,5
Soldier,"Men, you'll be going off to combat soon. It's important that you be prepared for anything.",5
Katara,"[  Scared.  ] Aang, do something! Use your airbending!",5
Aang,[  Excitedly.  ] Yeah! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster!,5
Aang,Sorry!,5
Cabbage merchant,[  Grasping his head in despair.  ] My cabbages! [  Angrily.  ] You're gonna pay for this!,5
Aang,[  Sheepishly.  ] Two cabbages please.,5
Guard,"Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism, traveling under false pretenses, and malicious destruction of cabbages.",5
Cabbage merchant,"[  Jumping agitatedly up and down, waving his left fist in the air.  ] Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage!",5
Guard,"[  Gesturing at the merchant.  ] Silence! Only the king can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, sire?",5
Bumi,"[  Raising his hand.  ] Throw them ... [  Sokka, Katara, and Aang gasp.  ] a feast!",5
Bumi,"[  To Aang.  ] The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts, [  Leaning in over Aang, grabbing the chicken leg that is on his plate, holding it in front of him.  ] so I hope you like your chicken with no skin.",5
Aang,"Thanks, but I don't eat meat.",5
Bumi,[  To Sokka.  ] How about you? I bet you like meat.,5
Katara,"[  Quietly to Aang.  ] Is it just me, or [  Turns circles with her index finger beside her temple, implying the king is crazy.  ] is this guy's crown a little crooked?",5
Bumi,"[  Aerial shot of the dining table as Bumi pulls up to his seat.  ] So tell me, young bald one, [  Sitting down.  ] where are you from?",5
Aang,[  Close-up.  ] I'm from ... Kangaroo Island!,5
Bumi,"[  Cut to the King, two guards standing watch behind him.  ] Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hopping!",5
Sokka,[  Stops laughing; unsure.  ] What? It was pretty funny.,5
Bumi,"[  Cut back to the king, who lazily stretches his arms, and yawns.  ] Well, all these good jokes are making me tired. Guess it's time to hit the hay.",5
Bumi,"[  Gesturing at Aang.  ] There's an airbender in our presence, and not just any airbender. [  Close-up as he decisively stands up.  ] The Avatar!",5
Bumi,"[  Sits down again.  ] Now, what do you have to say for yourself, [  Close-up, smiling satisfied.  ] Mr. Pippinpaddleopsicopolis?",5
Aang,"[  Standing up, throwing his hands in the air.  ] Okay, you caught me. [  Frontal shot of the three friends.  ] I'm the Avatar. Doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out. [  Aang looks underneath table.  ] No firebenders here. So, good work, everybody! [  Pulling Katara and Sokka into a hug.  ] Love each other, [  Cut to a dismayed looking king.  ] respect all life, [  Cut to a shot of the threesome walking backward toward the exit.  ] and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time!",5
Katara,[  Accusingly.  ] You can't keep us here! Let us leave!,5
Bumi,Lettuce leaf?,5
Sokka,[  Cut to the threesome. Sokka holds his hand for his mouth; whispering.  ] We're in serious trouble. This guy is  nuts.,5
Bumi,"[  Close-up.  ] Tomorrow, the Avatar will [  Slowly zooming in close-up of Aang.  ] face three deadly challenges. [  Back to Bumi.  ] But for now, the guards will show you to your chamber.",5
Chamberlain,"[  Leaning in toward Bumi.  ] My liege, do you mean the good chamber or the bad chamber?",5
Bumi,[  Turning to the guard.  ] The newly refurbished chamber.,5
Chamberlain,"[  Putting finger in the air.  ] Wait, which one are we talking about?",5
Bumi,"The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing, that is. Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them. [  Switch to a frontal shot of the three children as they are being led out of the room, flanked by two guards. Commanding.  ] Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!",5
Katara,This is a prison cell? But it's so nice.,5
Aang,[  Momo jumps off Aang's shoulders and onto a bed.  ] He did say it was newly refurbished.,5
Sokka,"Nice or not, we're prisoners!",5
Aang,[  Close-up; worried.  ] I wonder what these challenges are gonna to be.,5
Katara,[  Determined.  ] We're not sticking around to find out. There's got to be some way out of here.,5
Aang,[  Excitedly pointing at something at the other side of the room.  ] The air vents!,5
Sokka,"[  Harshly.  ] If you think we're going to fit through there, you're crazier than that king.",5
Aang,"[  Turning to Sokka.  ]  We  can't, but Momo can!",5
Aang,"[  Hopeful.  ] Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!",5
Aang,"Go on, boy, get Appa!",5
Sokka,"Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?",5
Aang,[  Voice-over.  ] Appa's a ten-ton flying bison; I think he could figure something out.,5
Katara,"[  Climbing into her bed.  ] Well, no point arguing about it now. Get some rest, Aang. [  Aang walks toward his bed.  ] Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow.",5
Aang,[  Alarmed.  ] Sokka? [  Switch to Aang's point of view; the other beds are empty.  ] Katara? [  Frontal shot as Aang turns toward the guard.  ] Where are my friends?,5
Guard,[  Frontal shot.  ] The king will free them if you complete your challenges.,5
Aang,[  Frontal shot; unsure.  ] And if I fail?,5
Guard,"[  Frontal shot.  ] He didn't say. [  Extending his arm; switch back to a shot of the guard.  ] Your staff, please?",5
Bumi,"[  Serious.  ] First, Avatar, [  Frontal shot as Bumi spread his arms, showing off his purple outfit; lighthearted.  ] what do you think of my new outfit? I want your honest opinion. [  Frontal shot of Aang who blankly stares at the king. Someone coughs during the ensuing silence. Switch back to a frontal shot of Bumi.  ] I'm waiting.",5
Aang,[  Scratching his head.  ] I ... guess it's fine.,5
Bumi,Excellent! You passed the first test.,5
Aang,Really?,5
Bumi,"[  Upbeat.  ] Well, not one of the deadly tests. [  Waving his finger from side to side, emphasizing his words.  ] The real challenges are much more, uh, challenging.",5
Aang,[  Aggressively.  ] I don't have time for your crazy games! [  Close-up of King Bumi.  ] Give me my friends back! We're leaving!,5
Bumi,"Oh, I thought you might refuse, [  Side shot of the two. A wall opens, revealing Katara and Sokka struggling in the grasp of a guard. Aang turns to them.  ] so I will give your friends some special souvenirs.",5
Bumi,"[  Voice-over.  ] Those delightful rings are made of pure jennamite, also known as creeping crystal. It's a crystal that grows remarkably fast. [  Close-up of Bumi; sinister.  ] By nightfall your friends will be completely covered in it. [  Slightly sympathetic.  ] Terrible thing, really. [  Serious.  ] I can stop it, but  only  if you cooperate.",5
Sokka,[  Panicking.  ] Ah! It's already creeping!,5
Aang,[  Cut back to a side shot of Aang and Bumi; serious.  ] I'll do what you want.,5
Bumi,"It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry. Ooh, there it is! [  Bumi points to inside the waterfall.  ] Would you mind fetching it for me?",5
Bumi,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Ooh, climbing the ladder. No one's thought of  that  before.",5
Bumi,That's right. Keep diving head in. I'm sure it'll work eventually.,5
Aang,There! Enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back  now  !,5
Bumi,"Ah, not yet. I need help with another matter. It seems I've lost my pet, Flopsie.",5
Aang,Okay! Found him!,5
Bumi,Bring him to me. Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsie!,5
Aang,"Come here, Flopsie. [  Flopsie jumps down behind Aang, startling both him and the bunny.  ] Huh?",5
Aang,"Flopsie, wait! Flopsie! [  Cut to Bumi laughing. Back to Aang chasing the bunny.  ] Flopsie!",5
Aang,Wait a minute. [  Close-up of Flopsie snarling. Cut to behind Aang.  ] Flopsie?,5
Aang,Flopsie!,5
Bumi,"[  Rubbing Flopsie's belly.  ] Oh, that's a good boy. Yes, who has a soft belly?",5
Aang,"[  Aang jumps up to where Katara and Sokka. Both are encased in crystal to their shoulders.  ] Guys, are you okay?",5
Katara,"Other than the crystals slowly encasing my entire body, doing great!",5
Bumi,"[  Rubbing Flopsie's belly.  ] Oh, yes.",5
Aang,Come on! I'm ready for the next challenge.,5
Bumi,"Your final test is a duel. And as a special treat, you may choose your opponent.",5
Bumi,Point and choose.,5
Aang,"So ... you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?",5
Bumi,Choose wisely!,5
Aang,I ... choose ... you. [  Aang points to the king.  ],5
Bumi,Wrong choice!,5
Bumi,"You thought I was a frail old man, but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever see.",5
Aang,Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?,5
Bumi,There are no take-backsies in my kingdom. You might need this. [  Points to the guard standing near Katara and Sokka.  ],5
Bumi,Typical airbender tactic: avoid and evade. I hoped the Avatar would be less predictable.,5
Bumi,Don't you have any surprises for me? Sooner or later you'll have to strike back!,5
Bumi,You'll have to be a little more creative than that!,5
Bumi,Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here. Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?,5
Bumi,How are you going to get me from way over there?,5
Bumi,"Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart. [  He tosses the boulder aside and bends up to the balcony where the two siblings are almost completely encased. Aang joins him.  ] You've passed all my tests. Now, you must answer one question.",5
Aang,That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.,5
Bumi,"Oh, but what's the point of tests if you don't learn anything?",5
Sokka,"Oh, come on!",5
Bumi,Answer this one question and I will set your friends free. What ... is my name? From the looks of your friends I'd say you only have a few minutes.,5
Aang,How am I supposed to know his name?,5
Katara,Think about the challenges. Maybe it's some kind of riddle.,5
Sokka,I got it!,5
Aang,Yeah?,5
Sokka,"He's an earthbender, right? Rocky. You know, because of all the rocks.",5
Katara,"We're going to keep trying, but that is a good back-up.",5
Aang,"Okay. So back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall, I saved his pet, and I had a duel.",5
Katara,And what did you learn?,5
Aang,"Well, everything was different than I expected.",5
Katara,[  The jennamite grows as she talks with anxiety.  ] And?,5
Aang,"Well, they weren't straight forward. To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. I know his name.",5
Aang,"I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. [  The king laughs with the same odd snort Bumi did a hundred years ago.  ] Bumi, you're a mad genius.",5
Bumi,"Oh Aang, it's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally.",5
Katara,"Uh, over here!",5
Sokka,Little help?,5
Bumi,Jennamite is made of rock candy. [  He takes a bite into the crystal.  ] Delicious!,5
Katara,So this crazy king is your old friend Bumi?,5
Bumi,"Who are you calling old? Okay, I'm old.",5
Sokka,Why did you do all of this instead of just telling Aang who you were?,5
Bumi,"First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people. [  Snorts.  ] But I do have a reason. Aang, you have a difficult task ahead. The world has changed in the hundred years that you've been gone. It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn. You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord. And when you do, I hope you will think like a mad genius. And it looks like you're in good hands. You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation. [  Momo climbs up on Aang.  ] And you'll need Momo, too.",5
Aang,"Thank you for your wisdom, but before we leave, I have a challenge for you.",5
Cabbage merchant,My cabbages!,5
Aang,"[  Enthusiastically.  ] Great, you're back!",6
Aang,What's for dinner?,6
Sokka,"[  Digs nuts from his bag.  ] We've got a few options. First; round nuts. And some kind of oval shaped nuts? And some rock-shaped nuts, that might just be rocks. [  Throws the rock-shaped nut toward Momo.  ] Dig in! [  Aang and Katara look at each other then back at Sokka.  ]",6
Katara,Seriously ... what else you got?,6
Sokka,What was that?,6
Aang,It's coming from over there!,6
Sokka,[  Aang and Katara run off-camera.  ] Shouldn't we run  away  from huge booms? Not toward them?,6
Katara,An earthbender!,6
Aang,Let's go meet him!,6
Sokka,"He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.",6
Katara,"[  Suddenly Katara is a few feet in front of them, excitedly addressing the earthbender.  ] Hello there! I'm Katara! What's your name?",6
Aang,[  Sokka and Aang approach Katara; yelling.  ] Nice to meet you!,6
Katara,[  Shrugging.  ] I just wanted to say hi.,6
Aang,Hey! That guy's gotta be running somewhere. Maybe we're near a village? And I bet that village has a market!,6
Katara,[  Excitedly.  ] Which means no nuts for dinner!,6
Sokka,"[  Katara and Aang chase after Haru.  ] Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! [  Momo flies overhead, chasing Katara and Aang.  ] Yeah, I hate 'em too. [  Slowly follows Katara and Aang.  ]",6
Aang,Great hat! [  Tries on the hat.  ] I'll trade you some nuts for it.,6
Katara,[  Notices the boy enter a shop. Speaks to herself in surprise.  ] Hey ...,6
Haru,"Hi, Mom.",6
Haru's mother,"Where have you been, Haru? You're late! Get started on your chores.",6
Katara,"[  Enters the shop's front door, startling Haru.  ] Hey. You're that kid. Why did you run away before?",6
Haru,"Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid.",6
Aang,"[  Aang and Sokka enter the shop.  ] No, she doesn't. We saw you earthbending.",6
Haru's mother,[  Standing by the window.  ] They saw you doing what?!,6
Haru,"They're crazy, Mom! I mean, look at how they're dressed.",6
Haru's mother,You  know  how dangerous that is! You know what would happen if  they  caught you earthbending!,6
Tax collector,[  Heavy knocks on the door.  ] Open up!,6
Sokka,[  Sokka peeks through the window's blinds.  ] Fire Nation! Act natural!,6
Haru's mother,[  The tax collector stares sourly toward the four children; aggressively.  ] What do you want? I've already paid you this week!,6
Tax collector,"The tax just doubled. [  Arrogantly.  ] And we wouldn't want an accident, would we? [  Creates a ball of fire between his hands, making everyone slightly back away.  ] Fire is sometimes so hard to control.",6
Tax collector,"You can keep the copper ones. [  Walks away, dropping four copper pieces to the floor, exits.  ]",6
Sokka,[  Door slams.  ] Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?,6
Haru's mother,Five years. Fire Lord Ozai uses our town's coal mines to fuel his ships.,6
Haru,They're thugs. They steal from us. And everyone here's too much of a coward to do anything about it.,6
Haru's mother,"[  Angered.  ] Quiet, Haru! Don't talk like that.",6
Katara,"[  Curiously.  ] But, Haru's an earthbender? He can help!",6
Haru's mother,Earthbending is forbidden. It's caused nothing but misery for this village! [  Casts a meaningful glance toward her son.  ] He must never use his abilities.,6
Katara,How can you say that? Haru has a gift! Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.,6
Haru's mother,[  Shakes head in dismay.  ] You don't understand.,6
Katara,I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?,6
Haru's mother,They could take Haru away! Like they took his father.,6
Haru,My mom said you can sleep here tonight. But you should leave in the morning.,6
Aang,Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.,6
Katara,I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father.,6
Haru,"That's okay. It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store? It reminded me of him.",6
Katara,[  Flattered.  ] Thanks.,6
Haru,"My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one. But they fought back anyway.",6
Katara,He sounds like a great man.,6
Haru,"[  Stops.  ] After the attack, they rounded up my father and every other earthbender, and took them away. [  Kneels.  ] We haven't seen them since.",6
Katara,So that's why you hide your earthbending.,6
Haru,"Yeah. Problem is ... [  Close-up, earthbends two stones in a circle above his hand.  ] the only way I can feel close to my father now [  Crushes the stones to sand with his hands. The sand blows away.  ] is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.",6
Katara,"[  Sits beside Haru, sets her fingertips on her necklace.  ] See this necklace? My mother gave it to me.",6
Haru,It's beautiful.,6
Katara,"I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. [  Hangs her head, turning away.  ] This necklace is all I have left of her.",6
Haru,"It's not enough, is it?",6
Katara,No. [  Hangs her head and turns away.  ],6
Old man,"Help, help!",6
Haru,The mine!,6
Old man,Help me!,6
Katara,[  Haru braces his back against the mine entrance. Katara pulls the old man.  ] Ugh! It's not working! We have to get help!,6
Haru,"There's no time, pull harder!",6
Katara,[  Getting an idea.  ] Haru. There's a way  you  can help him.,6
Haru,[  Guilty fear.  ] I  can't.,6
Katara,"Please, there's no one around to see you. It's the only way!",6
Katara,[  Excitedly.  ] Haru! You did it! [  The two take place beside the old man and aid him walking away from the mine.  ],6
Katara,It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.,6
Aang,You must have  really  inspired him.,6
Katara,I guess so.,6
Sokka,"Everyone should get some sleep, we're leaving at dawn.",6
Katara,[  Unhappily.  ] Dawn?! Can't we sleep in for once?,6
Sokka,"[  Commandingly.  ] Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Goodnight.",6
Katara,"[  Slyly, with a wry smirk.  ] I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.",6
Sokka,[  With finality.  ]  Goodnight!,6
Old man,[  Points accusingly.  ] That's him! That's the earthbender!,6
Katara,[  Enters barn to see Aang and Sokka folding blankets; emotionally.  ] They took him! They took Haru away!,6
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] What?,6
Katara,[  Hurriedly.  ] The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation - it's all my fault - I forced him into earthbending!,6
Sokka,"[  Steps beside her, taking her hand in his and laying his other hand supportively behind her shoulder.  ] Slow down, Katara. When did this happen?",6
Katara,Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.,6
Sokka,"Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone.",6
Katara,"[  Turns defiantly to the open door, clenches fists.  ] We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.",6
Aang,[  Confused.  ] And ... why would they do that?,6
Katara,[  Determined.  ] Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending. [  Aang and Sokka share a horrified look.  ],6
Sokka,"I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and  ta-da!  Fake earthbending.",6
Katara,"[  Props hands off hips, turns to Aang.  ] Aang? Did you get all that?",6
Aang,"[  Snapping small puffs of air at a sooty copper fritillary butterfly; dismissively.  ] Sure, sure. I got it.",6
Sokka,Do you remember your cue?,6
Aang,"[  Continues snapping puffs of air; still dismissive.  ] Yeah, yeah. Just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this.",6
Sokka,"[  Aggravated.  ] By  this,  do you mean intentionally being captured by a group of ruthless firebenders?",6
Aang,[  Humored.  ] Exactly! That's fun stuff!,6
Sokka,[  Group of firebenders with spears approach.  ] Here they come! Get in your places!,6
Sokka,"[  While angrily pointing at Katara.  ] Get out of my way, pipsqueak! [  The soldiers watch in confusion. One of them even raises an eyebrow.  ]",6
Katara,"[  Angrily hunched over.  ] How  dare  you call me pipsqueak, you giant-eared cretin!",6
Sokka,[  Just as angrily hunched over.  ] What did you call me?,6
Katara,[  Far too dramatically as her hair loopies move with her motion.  ] A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things! Do herds of animals use them for shade?! [  Imitates an elephant's ears.  ],6
Sokka,"[  Towers over his sister.  ] You better back off! [  Slips his hand by his mouth and mutters.  ] Seriously, back off.",6
Katara,"[  More determined, heightens above her now-cowering brother.  ] I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large  your  ears are!",6
Sokka,That's it! You're going down!,6
Katara,"I'll show  you  who's boss! [  Angrily points at Sokka.  ] Earthbending style! [  Over-dramatically leaps toward the boulder, clenching her fist upward to which there is no reaction. Angrily.  ] I said,  earthbending style  !",6
Guard,[  Points a finger to the lemur; surprised.  ] That lemur! He's earthbending!,6
Sokka,"[  Katara and Momo each remain in their positions. Katara eyes the man in surprise. Sokka, angrily, waves his arms toward her.  ] No, you idiot, it's the girl!",6
Guard,Oh. [  Blushes shamefully.  ] Of course.,6
Sokka,I'll hold her. [  Close-up. Whispers to Katara.  ] You've got twelve hours to find Haru. We'll be right behind you.,6
Sokka,"[  Eyeballs Momo perched off of Aang's shoulder. Points accusingly.  ] Momo,  you  have some big ears! [  Momo folds his ears back, hunches down, and coos in protest.  ]",6
Sokka,"[  Aang stares nervously at the barge carrying Katara to the prison.  ] She'll be fine, Aang. Katara knows what she's doing.",6
Warden,"[  Smugly.  ] Earthbenders. It is my pleasure to welcome you aboard my modest shipyard. I am your warden. I prefer to think of you not as prisoners, [  Quips smartly.  ] but as honored guests. And I hope you come to think of me as your humble and caring host. [  Paces nonchalantly.  ] You will succeed here, if you simply abide-",6
Warden,[  Very angrily.  ] What kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting him?! Take him below! [  Swings his arms. Some guards escort the man away. Mutters.  ] One week in solitary will improve his manners. [  Continues smug gait.  ] Simply treat me with the courtesy that I give you-,6
Warden,And we'll get along  famously.,6
Warden,"You will notice, earthbenders, that this rig is made entirely of metal. You are miles away from any rock or earth. [  Katara pauses, glancing over the expansive ocean to the land far away.  ] So, if you have any illusions about employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending among you people ... [  Lowly.  ] forget them. It is impossible. Good day.",6
Haru,[  Surprised.  ] Katara?,6
Katara,[  Excitedly. Runs and hugs Haru.  ] Haru!,6
Haru,[  Confused.  ] What are you doing here?,6
Katara,[  Somewhat apologetically.  ] It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.,6
Haru,"[  Shocked.  ] So, you got yourself arrested?",6
Katara,It was the only way to find you.,6
Haru,"You've got guts, Katara. I'll give you that. [  Places hand on her shoulder.  ] Come on. There's someone I want you to meet.",6
Haru,"Katara. This is my father, Tyro. [  The older man looks up.  ] Dad. This is Katara.",6
Katara,[  Slightly bows.  ] It's an honor to meet you.,6
Tyro,"[  Hands Katara a bowl.  ] Have some dinner, Katara. [  Katara accepts the bowl, but grimaces.  ] It's not as bad as it looks. [  Katara tries a spoonful, but becomes further disgusted. He finds humor in this with a small chuckle.  ] It's still pretty bad though.",6
Prisoner,[  Walks up and lays a hand on Tyro's shoulder.  ] Tyro. The prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around.,6
Tyro,"I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of. The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.",6
Katara,"If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?",6
Tyro,Excuse me?,6
Katara,"You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny, sabotage?",6
Tyro,The plan? The plan is to survive. Wait out this war. Hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.,6
Katara,[  Shocked.  ] How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up!,6
Tyro,"Katara, I admire your courage. And I envy your youth. But people's lives are at stake here. The warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless.",6
Katara,[  Obstinately.  ] We'll see about that.,6
Katara,"Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. [  The watchman walks up to talk the warden, but the warden stops him and listens.  ] Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your  courage  . And it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage earthbenders, [  Shouts clearly.  ] let us fight for our freedom!",6
Sokka,Your twelve hours are up; where's Haru? We've gotta get outta here!,6
Katara,I can't.,6
Sokka,[  Hurriedly.  ] We don't have much time. There are guards everywhere. Get on!,6
Aang,"[  Concerned.  ] Katara, what's wrong?",6
Katara,I'm not leaving. [  Aang and Sokka share a questionable look.  ] I'm not giving up on these people.,6
Sokka,What do you mean you're not leaving?,6
Katara,We can't abandon these people! There has to be a way to help them.,6
Aang,"Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka?",6
Sokka,"I say you're both crazy! [  The trio ducks a searching spotlight.  ] Last chance! We need to leave, now!",6
Katara,[  Sternly.  ] No!,6
Sokka,"[  Shakes his head dismally.  ] I hate when you get like this. Come on, we better hide.",6
Aang,[  Katara and Sokka flee. Aang whispers to Appa before joining them.  ] Go hide.,6
Captain,[  Appa soars overhead to fly away and hide.  ] Look!,6
Warden,Tell me exactly what you saw.,6
Captain,"Well, sir, it looked like a flying bison.",6
Warden,[  Surprised.  ] What?,6
Guard,"It was a giant flying buffalo, sir. With an empty saddle.",6
Warden,Which was it? A buffalo or a bison?,6
Captain,"Uh, I'm not sure what the difference is, but that's not really the point, is it, sir?",6
Warden,"[  Furiously.  ] I'll decide what the point is, fool!",6
Warden,[  To the second guard as he straightens up.  ] You! Wake up the captain. Search the entire rig! [  Turns to walk away.  ],6
Guard,"Uh, sir.",6
Warden,[  Annoyed.  ] What?,6
Guard,"[  Somewhat timidly.  ] That was ... the captain you just threw overboard, so ...",6
Warden,[  Still quite annoyed.  ] Then wake up someone I  haven't  thrown overboard and search the rig! There's something going on here and I don't like it.,6
Sokka,We don't have much time. What are we gonna do?,6
Aang,I wish I knew how to make a hurricane!,6
Aang,The warden would run away and we'd steal his keys!,6
Sokka,Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?,6
Aang,I'm just tossing ideas around.,6
Katara,"I tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but, it didn't work! If there was just a way to help them help themselves.",6
Sokka,"For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock. Something they can bend.",6
Katara,[  Lays her palm to the surface.  ] But this entire place is made of metal!,6
Aang,"No, it's not. [  Points to smokestacks.  ] Look at the smoke! I bet they're burning coal. In other words,  earth.",6
Katara,It's almost dawn. We're running out of time! You sure this is gonna work?,6
Sokka,"It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. [  The camera zooms through a visual walkthrough of Sokka's explanation.  ] There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo. And the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go, right back here.",6
Guard,There's the intruder!,6
Sokka,"Stay back! I'm warning you! [  Pulls out his boomerang, turning back-to-back with his sister.  ]",6
Tyro,"[  Roughly.  ] Katara, stop! You can't win this fight!",6
Warden,"Listen to him well, child. You're one mistake away from dying where you stand.",6
Katara,"[  Lifting up a piece of coal.  ] Here's your chance, earthbenders! Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!",6
Warden,"[  Bursts out into highly amused laughter.  ] Foolish girl. You thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people? Look at these blank, hopeless faces. Their spirits were broken a long time ago. [  Katara's expression dims as she does as instructed, staring at the forlorn prisoners.  ] Oh, but you still believe in them. How sweet. They're a waste of your energy little girl. You  failed.",6
Warden,[  Guards line up and prepare for battle.  ] Show no mercy! [  The guards send a blast of fire as one toward the rebelling prisoners.  ],6
Tyro,"[  The earthbenders work together to haul a sizable mass of coal to block the fire.  ] For the Earth Kingdom, attack!",6
Tyro,Get to the ships! We'll hold them off!,6
Warden,Do not let them escape!,6
Aang,[  Generates an air funnel and holds it between his hands; to Katara and Sokka.  ] Guys! Throw me some coal!,6
Warden,"[  Pleading.  ] No, please! I can't swim!",6
Tyro,Don't worry. I hear cowards float. [  Drops their enemies into the ocean.  ],6
Haru,I want to thank you for saving me. For saving us.,6
Katara,[  Turning to face Haru. Denying.  ] All it took was a little coal.,6
Haru,"It wasn't the coal, Katara. It was you. [  Katara blushes.  ]",6
Tyro,"Thank you for helping me find my courage, Katara of the Water Tribe. My family and everyone here owes you much.",6
Katara,"So, I guess you're going home now.",6
Tyro,Yes. To take back my village. [  Raises his voice to the crowd on the lower deck.  ] To take back all of our villages! The Fire Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land! [  Crowd cheers at Tyro's bravado.  ],6
Haru,[  To Katara.  ] Come with us.,6
Katara,"I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole. [  Gazes over the rail to see Momo join Aang atop Appa's head, floating in the ocean.  ]",6
Haru,"That's him, isn't it? The Avatar. [  Aang airbends an encased piece of coal. Momo jumps into his lap.  ] Katara, thank you for bringing my father back to me. I never thought I'd see him again. I only wish there was some way ...",6
Katara,"I know. [  Reaches for her necklace wistfully, but realizes it is not around her neck and panics.  ] My mother's necklace! It's gone!",6
Katara,"[  Voice-over; somewhat dreamily.  ] Those clouds look so soft, [  Cut to Aang sitting lazily atop Appa's head, a twig in his mouth; the view pans to the left, showing Sokka carving something with an uninterested look on his face, Katara lying on her stomach, popped up on her elbows, staring dreamingly over the rim of Appa's saddle, and Momo sleeping on the luggage.  ] don't they? Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft, cottony heap?",7
Sokka,[  Turns to Katara; mockingly with a smile.  ] Maybe you should give it a try.,7
Katara,[  Looks at Sokka with annoyance; sarcastically as she looks away from him.  ] You're hilarious.,7
Aang,"[  Frontal shot; excitedly.  ] I'll try it! [  Carrying his staff, he jumps off Appa with a big smile on his face. As he begins to fall, he turns once around his axis, winking at the camera as he passes. He falls down spreadeagled, laughing joyously.  ] Yeah!",7
Aang,"[  Looking at himself.  ] Turns out, clouds are made of water.",7
Katara,"Hey, what is that?",7
Sokka,[  Camera zooms in.  ] It's like a scar ...,7
Sokka,"[  Voice-over.  ] Listen. [  Cut to a frontal shot of a sad-looking Aang, his friends behind him.  ] It's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.",7
Katara,Aang? Are you okay?,7
Sokka,[  Noticing footprints; angrily.  ] Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for -,7
Katara,Shhh!,7
Sokka,[  Whispering angrily.  ] What? I'm not allowed to be angry?,7
Aang,[  Kneels down and sighs. He picks up some ash as it slowly seeps through his hand and drops to the ground; sadly.  ] Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?,7
Katara,"Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you.",7
Aang,"[  Sadly.  ] Yes, it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But I don't know how to do my job.",7
Katara,That's why we're going to the North Pole. [  Smiling softly.  ] To find you a teacher.,7
Aang,Yeah. A waterbending teacher. But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.,7
Sokka,The Avatar before you? He died over a hundred years ago; how are you supposed to talk to him?,7
Aang,I don't know. [  Momo comes up to Aang and settles in his lap.  ],7
Zuko,Uncle! It's time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh!,7
Iroh,[  Relaxing in a hot spring.  ] Over here!,7
Zuko,Uncle? We need to move on. We're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him.,7
Iroh,"You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?",7
Zuko,My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go!,7
Iroh,You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself. [  He breathes steam through his nose.  ],7
Zuko,Enough! We need to leave now. Get out of the water!,7
Iroh,"Very well! [  He gets up, exposing himself.  ]",7
Zuko,"[  Shielding his eyes.  ] On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes? But be back at the ship in a half-hour or I'm leaving without you!",7
Katara,"[  Approaches Aang.  ] Hey, Aang! You ready to be cheered up?",7
Aang,"[  Sadly.  ] No. [  An acorn is thrown at him.  ] Ow! Hey, how is that cheering me up?",7
Sokka,"[  Chuckles.  ] Cheered me up. [  An acorn gets thrown at him.  ] Ow. Yeah, I probably deserved that.",7
Katara,"These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back! Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back. [  She places the acorn in his hand and closes it.  ]",7
Aang,"Thanks, Katara.",7
Sokka,"Hey, who are you?",7
Kay-fon,"When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible! [  Approaches Aang.  ] But, those markings ... are you the Avatar, child? [  Aang look to Katara, who nods. He nods himself.  ] My village desperately needs your help!",7
Kay-fon,This young person is the Avatar!,7
Senlin Village leader,"So, the rumors of your return are true! It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence.",7
Aang,Nice to meet you too! So ... is there something I can help you with?,7
Senlin Village leader,I'm not sure ...,7
Kay-fon,"Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope! [  To Aang.  ] For the last few days at sunset, a spirit monster comes and attacks our village. He is Hei Bai, the black and white spirit.",7
Sokka,Why is it attacking you?,7
Senlin Village leader,"We do not know, but each of the last three nights, he has abducted one of our own. We are especially fearful because the winter solstice draws near.",7
Katara,What happens then?,7
Kay-fon,"As the solstice approaches, the natural world and the Spirit World grow closer and closer until the line between them is blurred completely.",7
Senlin Village leader,"Hei Bai is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the solstice is here, there's no telling what will happen.",7
Aang,"So, what do you want me to do, exactly?",7
Kay-fon,Who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the Spirit World than the Avatar himself? You are the great bridge between man and spirits.,7
Aang,Right ... that's me.,7
Katara,"Hey great bridge guy, could I talk to you over here for a second? [  She leads him toward a window.  ] Aang, you seem a little unsure about all of this.",7
Aang,"Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World. It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!",7
Katara,So ... can you help these people?,7
Aang,"I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just ... come to me. [  Momo lands on his shoulder.  ]",7
Katara,"[  With a kind and reassuring smile.  ] I think you can do it, Aang.",7
Sokka,[  With a similar expression.  ] Yeah. [  Brief pause.  ] We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster.,7
Iroh,"Who's there? [  He sees a rat-like animal.  ] A meadow vole! I should have known. [  He takes the creature into the palm of his hand.  ] You startled me, little one. [  Sighs.  ] It seems I dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.",7
Soldier,[  Picks up Iroh's clothes.  ] He's a Fire Nation soldier.,7
Earthbender captain,"He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West. The once-great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.",7
Aang,"[  Walking toward the village entrance.  ] Hello, Spirit? Can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm here to try to help stuff.",7
Sokka,This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.,7
Kay-fon,"If anyone can save us, he can.",7
Sokka,He still shouldn't have to face this alone.,7
Aang,"The sun has set. Where are you, Hei Bai? Well ... spirit ... uhhh ... I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace. [  He spins his staff and sticks it down, in apparent authority.  ] Okay ... well ... I guess that's settled, then.",7
Aang,You must be the Hei Bai spirit. My name is–,7
Aang,"My name's Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help. Hey, wait up! [  Hei Bai wreaks havoc, smashing buildings and destroying a tower with energy.  ] Uhhh ...",7
Senlin Village leader,The Avatar's methods are ... unusual.,7
Sokka,It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him.,7
Kay-fon,No. Only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei Bai.,7
Katara,"Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka. [  Closes her eyes in satisfaction.  ]",7
Aang,"Please, would you stop destroying things and listen? I'm trying to do my job as spirit bridge! Excuse me, would you please turn around? [  Shouts.  ] I command you to turn around now!",7
Sokka,That's it. He needs help. [  Exits the building.  ],7
Katara,"Sokka, wait! [  Starts to follow him.  ]",7
Senlin Village leader,[  Stops her.  ] It's not safe!,7
Sokka,"Hei Bai, over here! [  He throws his boomerang at him, but it barely affects the monster. He runs toward it.  ]",7
Aang,"Sokka, go back!",7
Sokka,"We'll fight him together, Aang.",7
Aang,"I don't want to fight him unless I– [  Sokka is taken by the Hei Bai, and the spirit flees. Aang chases it.  ]",7
Katara,[  Running to the village entrance.  ] Sokka! [  The villagers go the entrance as well. Katara is left standing fearful.  ],7
Zuko,"Uncle! Uncle, where are you?",7
Fire Nation Soldier,"Sir, maybe he thought you left without him.",7
Zuko,Something's not right here. That pile of rocks.,7
Fire Nation Soldier,"It looks like there's been a landslide, sir.",7
Zuko,Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. [  Stands up straight.  ] My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!,7
Sokka,Aang! Over here! Help!,7
Aang,"Hang on, Sokka!",7
Aang,Sokka! [  He realizes Sokka is nowhere to be seen.  ] I failed.,7
Iroh,Where are you taking me?,7
Earthbender captain,We're taking you to face justice.,7
Iroh,"Right, but where, specifically?",7
Earthbender captain,"A place you're quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.",7
Iroh,"Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.",7
Earthbender captain,"It was greater than you were, apparently.",7
Iroh,"I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired. [  Yawns.  ] And I'm still tired.",7
Kay-fon,I'm sure they'll be back.,7
Katara,I know.,7
Kay-fon,[  Places a blanket around her.  ] You should get some rest.,7
Katara,Everything's going to be okay ... [  She turns her blanket.  ],7
Kay-fon,"Your brother is in good hands. I would be shocked if the Avatar returned without him. [  As he is speaking, Aang approaches.  ]",7
Aang,"Katara? Katara, I lost him.",7
Kay-fon,The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon.,7
Aang,"[  His appearance is blue.  ] What? No, I'm right here! [  He waves his hand in the Wanderer's face, only to notice his own appearance.  ] I'm in the Spirit World!",7
Zuko,"[  Sniffs and gets a disgusted look.  ] Yeah, that's Uncle Iroh. [  He re-mounts his rhino.  ]",7
Aang,"I'll figure this out, Katara. I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is ... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem. [  Appa approaches.  ] Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here! [  He breathes on Katara.  ] But, I guess you can't see me either.",7
Katara,"It's okay, Appa, don't worry. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat. [  The two return the village.  ]",7
Aang,"What am I supposed to do? Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you? [  He turns his head in disappointment, when he hears something.  ] Sokka? [  He notices a dragon coming toward him.  ] That's definitely not Sokka. [  He tries to fly away but cannot. He notices his airbending is not working at all.  ] What? I can't airbend in the Spirit World. [  The dragon lands just before him.  ] You don't know where Sokka is, do you? [  The dragon touches him. He sees a vision of Roku flying on this dragon.  ] You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me! I need to save my friend and I don't know how! Is there some way for me to talk to Roku? [  The dragon curls around him, and he gets on him.  ] I'll be back, Katara. [  It gets up.  ] Take me to Roku! [  The dragon flies away.  ]",7
Earthbender captain,What's the problem?,7
Iroh,"Nothing. [  Pauses.  ] Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose.",7
Earthbender captain,Too loose?,7
Iroh,That's right. The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.,7
Earthbender captain,"Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner's handcuffs.",7
Aang,"Hey, what are you doing? [  He screams, but they fly right through the roof and into a mysterious room. Within is a celestial calendar and a statue of Roku.  ] I don't understand, this is just a statue of Roku. [  Fang presses one of his feelers to Aang's forehead. A vision of a comet appears to him.  ] Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him? [  Fang moves his head, allowing a light beam to appear. This is just to the right of Roku's statue. With another feeler press, he sees a vision of the sun setting and rising repeatedly, and the light closing in on Roku.  ] It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice! So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku? [  The dragon breathes an apparent yes.  ] But I can't wait that long! I need to save Sokka now! [  The dragon takes Aang from the temple.  ]",7
Soldier,"He's too dangerous, Captain! We just can't just carry him to the Capital! We have to do something now!",7
Earthbender captain,I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely.,7
Katara,"It's no use, Appa. I don't seem them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait. [  She re-directs Appa to the village's direction.  ]",7
Zuko,The Avatar!,7
Aang,Whoa!,7
Katara,You're back! [  She embraces Aang.  ] Where's Sokka?,7
Aang,I'm not sure ...,7
Earthbender captain,"These dangerous hands must be crushed. [  He brings up a boulder and prepares to drop it. However, Zuko jumps in and kicks the rock away before breaking Iroh's chain with his boot.  ]",7
Iroh,"Excellent form, Prince Zuko.",7
Zuko,You taught me well.,7
Earthbender captain,Surrender yourselves. It's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.,7
Iroh,"Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched.",7
Zuko,Now would you please put on some clothes?,7
Katara,"Aang, what are you doing?! Run!",7
Aang,"You're the spirit of this forest! Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back. [  He shows it the acorn and leaves it at his feet. The spirit picks it up and reverts to the panda form. It walks away peacefully. As it exits, a series of branches grow, and three villagers and Sokka emerge from it.  ]",7
Katara,"Sokka! [  She runs to him and embraces him, while other villagers embrace their loved ones.  ]",7
Sokka,What happened?,7
Katara,You were trapped in the Spirit World for 24 hours! How are you feeling?,7
Sokka,"Like I seriously need to use the bathroom. [  Sokka waddles away, displaying a nauseated look. She gives him an unsure gaze.  ]",7
Senlin Village leader,"Thank you, Avatar. If only there were a way to repay you for what you've done.",7
Sokka,"You could give us some supplies, and some money.",7
Katara,Sokka!,7
Sokka,What? We need stuff.,7
Senlin Village leader,It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey.,7
Katara,"I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do, all on your own.",7
Aang,"Actually, I did have a little help and there's something else.",7
Sokka,What is it?,7
Aang,I need to talk to Roku and I think I found a way to contact his spirit.,7
Katara,That's great!,7
Sokka,"Creepy, but great.",7
Aang,"There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him.",7
Katara,But the solstice is tomorrow!,7
Aang,"Yeah, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.",7
Aang,"[  Strained voice.  ] Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy! [  Appa roars in protest and sits down. Cut to a close side-view; Aang sadly addresses his pet.  ] Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. [  Frontal shot; looks down and away, sadly.  ] If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. [  Cut back to the side-shot; sternly, emphasizing his command by straightening himself.  ] So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!",8
Sokka,"[  Voice-over; Aang gasps in surprise and looks over his right shoulder and over his left, turning around in search for the origins of the voice.  ] I think his big butt is trying to tell ya something.",8
Katara,[  Desperately.  ] Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. [  Closer shot of Katara's pleading face.  ] Neither can I.,8
Aang,[  Looks away sadly and recalls an image of Sozin's Comet.  ] But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means! [  Side-shot as he approaches his friends.  ] I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice. That's today!,8
Katara,"We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.",8
Sokka,"[  Aang stares curiously.  ] At least, not without your friends. We got your back. [  Momo soars up and perches atop Aang's shoulder, and Appa licks Sokka, who angrily looks at the bison.  ] Ew!",8
Senlin Village leader,It's a long journey to the Crescent Island. [  Hands Aang a small bundle.  ] You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it before sundown. Good luck.,8
Aang,Thank you for your-,8
Senlin Village leader,"[  Interrupts sharply, yelling. Points toward the ocean.  ] Go!",8
Zuko,"[  The Senlin Village leader gasps.  ] Having trouble sleeping? [  Pushes the man back through the door, knocking him down. Frontal shot as he approaches him.  ] Seen the Avatar lately?",8
Aang,"Come on boy, we've got a long way to go. Faster!",8
Iroh,"[  Close-up.  ] Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!",8
Zuko,"I have no choice, Uncle.",8
Iroh,[  Angrily.  ] Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord  banished you  ? [  Fearfully.  ] What if you're caught?,8
Zuko,[  Breaks away from telescope to talk to his uncle.  ] I'm chasing the Avatar! My father will understand why I am returning home!,8
Iroh,You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type!,8
Zuko,[  Looks back into his telescope. Dark scope view reveals Appa mid-flight.  ] There they are. Helmsman! Full steam ahead!,8
Katara,[  Looking back to Zuko's ship.  ] Aang. We've got trouble!,8
Sokka,"[  Panicked.  ] Yeah! And it's gaining, fast!",8
Iroh,"[  Waving a fan at his face.  ] Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?",8
Zuko,[  Lights the stinking ball with a fire punch.  ] On my mark! Fire!,8
Katara,[  Yelling.  ] Fireball!,8
Aang,I'm on it!,8
Katara,"[  Aang, Katara, and Sokka all make faces and grasp their noses.  ] We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us!",8
Sokka,Can't you make Appa go any faster?,8
Aang,Yeah. But there's just one little problem.,8
Zuko,[  Close-up. Eyes widening.  ] A blockade.,8
Iroh,Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.,8
Aang,"If we fly north, we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade! It's the  only  way.",8
Katara,There's no time!,8
Aang,This is exactly why I didn't want you to come! It's too dangerous!,8
Katara,And that's  exactly  why we're here.,8
Sokka,[  Boldly.  ] Let's run this blockade! [  Both Katara and Sokka grin confidently.  ],8
Aang,"Appa, yip-yip! [  Appa roars readily, sailing forward even quicker.  ]",8
Zuko,He's not turning around!,8
Iroh,"Please Prince Zuko! If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do! Do not follow the Avatar.",8
Zuko,"[  Lowers his head, closes his eyes, and clenches his hands into fists. Sorrowfully.  ] I'm sorry, Uncle. [  Raises his head, opens his eyes, and thrusts his right hand forward commandingly.  ] Run the blockade!",8
Zhao,[  Gazing through telescope.  ] The Avatar. [  Lowers telescope lens to spot Zuko's ship.  ] And the banished prince. [  Lowers telescope.  ] This must be my lucky day.,8
Captain,Commander Zhao. What are your orders?,8
Zhao,"Shoot the bison down, captain.",8
Captain,"[  Surprised.  ] But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, sir! One of our own! What if it's hit?",8
Zhao,So be it. [  Captain backs up in shock. Zhao continues coolly.  ] It belongs to a traitor. [  Command.  ] Ignite. Launch!,8
Aang,"Appa, are you okay? [  Appa roars a reply. They soar higher into the clouds.  ]",8
Engineer,Prince Zuko! The engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs!,8
Zuko,"[  Spins away from the man, facing the blockade.  ] Do  not  stop this ship.",8
Zhao,Launch!,8
Aang,[  Cries out desperately.  ] Sokka! [  Whips the reins down and begins a speedy descent in chase of Sokka.  ],8
Zhao,"Ready ... [  Holds hand up, issuing his command.  ]",8
Zhao,Fire!,8
Aang,[  Ecstatic.  ] We made it!,8
Sokka,[  Katara and Sokka each grimacing in terror.  ] We got into the Fire Nation. [  Meekly.  ] Great.,8
Captain,"Where do you think the Avatar is headed, sir?",8
Zhao,"I'm not sure. [  Turns aside, gazes at Zuko's smoking ship.  ] But I bet a certain banished prince will know.",8
Iroh,We're on a collision course!,8
Zuko,[  Confidently.  ] We can make it!,8
Captain,"[  Captain stands ahead of a squad of nine firebenders.  ] The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, sir.",8
Zhao,"[  Swiftly.  ] Wait! Cut the engines, and let them pass.",8
Captain,Sir?,8
Aang,[  Close-up. Momo is shown bouncing about in eager surprise.  ] There it is! [  Sokka and Katara pop up in the saddle.  ] The island where Roku's dragon took me. [  Full view of Crescent Island and its smoking volcano as Appa descends.  ],8
Aang,"[  Rubs against Appa's head.  ] You did it buddy. Nice flying. [  Appa bellows in satisfaction, rolling to his side to wave his three legs into the air lazily. Appa's tongue lolls out.  ]",8
Katara,"[  Smiles sweetly and approaches Appa. Rubs his belly.  ] Aww, you must be tired.",8
Sokka,[  Joyous. Katara's expresses dumbfounded interest.  ] No! I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders! [  Continues to work out and flex his body.  ],8
Katara,[  Props hand off hip. Responds dryly.  ] I was talking to Appa.,8
Sokka,[  Instantly halts exercise.  ] Well ... I was talking to Momo. [  Points to the lemur clinging to a dead tree's branch.  ],8
Sokka,"[  Close-up, top-to-bottom view of the Fire Temple.  ] I don't see any guards.",8
Katara,[  Camera drops to show the group taking cover behind a lower wall below steps.  ] The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.,8
Aang,It's almost sundown. We better hurry! [  The group leaps over the wall and charges for the front door.  ],8
Sokka,[  The group tip-toes through an enormous chamber with fire-decor columns.  ] Wait. I think I heard something.,8
Great Fire Sage,"[  Turning around, they see five men standing in the hallway dressed in red with tall hats.  ] We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.",8
Aang,Great! I am the Avatar!,8
Great Fire Sage,We know. [  Inhales briskly before punching a blast of fire their direction.  ],8
Aang,[  Deflects three balls of fire with his airbending. Close-up. Shouts over his shoulder.  ] I'll hold them off. Run!,8
Great Fire Sage,"If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become! Split up and find him.",8
Aang,[  Hallway view; Aang skids in front of Katara and Sokka and continues running.  ] Follow me!,8
Sokka,Do you know where you're going? [  The two follow Aang.  ],8
Aang,"[  Rounds a corner and disappears from sight.  ] Nope! [  A moment passes, Katara and Sokka stop when Aang skids into view again. Fearfully.  ] Wrong way! [  Runs past them.  ]",8
Shyu,"[  Rounds the corner, frightening Sokka and Katara to chase after Aang.  ] Come back!",8
Shyu,I don't want to fight you! I am a friend.,8
Sokka,"Firebenders aren't our friends! [  Aang steps ahead of his friends, assuming an airbending posture.  ]",8
Shyu,"[  Steps toward the Avatar, before dropping to his knees and pressing his palms to the floor in submission. This startles Aang, Katara, and Sokka.  ] I know why you're here, Avatar.",8
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] You do?,8
Shyu,Yes. [  Rises from the floor to stand again.  ] You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.,8
Aang,[  Skeptically.  ] How?,8
Shyu,"[  Slides back a lamplight on the wall. Places palm on wall, focuses firebending into this location to open a secret passage.  ] This way.",8
Great Fire Sage,[  Echoes in the distance.  ] Find him.,8
Shyu,[  Briefly glances down the hall.  ] Time is running out! Quickly!,8
Zuko,"[  Close-up. Tightens knuckles on ship's railing. Smoke billows behind his ship.  ] What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?",8
Iroh,Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.,8
Zuko,"[  Close-up.  ] If Zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.",8
Shyu,[  Brief scene cut to show the sun nearly setting. Far overhead view of Shyu leading the group through caverns.  ] Avatar Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma.,8
Aang,Did you know Avatar Roku?,8
Shyu,No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.,8
Aang,Is that how you knew I was coming?,8
Shyu,"A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred. The statue of Avatar Roku; its eyes began to glow!",8
Katara,"That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too!",8
Shyu,"At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.",8
Aang,"If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me?",8
Shyu,"Things have changed. In the past, the sages were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came.",8
Aang,"[  Looking down, guiltily.  ] They were waiting for me.",8
Sokka,[  Humorously mocking.  ] Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late! [  Aang scowls heavily at Sokka.  ],8
Shyu,"They lost hope the Avatar would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozin began the War, my grandfather and the other sages were forced to follow him. [  Shakes head sadly.  ] I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other sages.",8
Aang,Thank you for helping me. [  Close-up as Shyu smiles to Aang.  ],8
Shyu,"[  Continues leading the group up a spiraling flight of stairs.  ] We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary. [  Time skip, Shyu continues talking as they near the top of the stairs.  ] Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue. Only then will you be able to speak with him.",8
Shyu,[  Gasps.  ] No!,8
Aang,"[  Approaches door.  ] Shyu, what's wrong?",8
Shyu,"The sanctuary doors, they're closed!",8
Katara,[  Aang tugs at the door uselessly.  ] Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?,8
Shyu,"No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise, the sages must open this door together, [  Sokka shown in deep thought.  ] with five simultaneous fire blasts.",8
Sokka,"[  Ponderously states.  ] Five fire blasts, huh? [  Zoom out to show a lamplight above him.  ] I think I can help you out.",8
Zuko,"Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail, while I use it as a cover.",8
Sokka,"[  Kneeling. Pours oil into a bag.  ] This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, [  Picks up bag, holds it proudly before him.  ] ta-da! Fake firebending!",8
Katara,"[  Impressed.  ] You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.",8
Shyu,This might actually work.,8
Shyu,"[  Time skip. Sokka places his last bag into the dragon's mouth.  ] The sages will hear the explosion, so as soon as they go off, you rush in!",8
Katara,[  Hides behind a column with her brother. Holds Momo. Glances to the next column where Aang hides.  ] It's almost sunset. Are you ready?,8
Aang,Definitely.,8
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] They're still locked!,8
Shyu,[  Sadly sighs. Sokka rises from hiding behind his sister.  ] It didn't work. [  Aang falls to his knees.  ],8
Aang,"[  Time skip. Everyone stands in front of the door. Aang beats upon it furiously with consecutive airbending slices.  ] Why, won't, it, open?!",8
Katara,"[  Presses forward. Seizes Aang's arm.  ] Aang! Stop! [  Relaxes, releasing his arm.  ] There's nothing else we can do ...",8
Aang,[  Glumly.  ] I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing.,8
Sokka,[  Examining the explosion. Runs his finger across the black soot.  ] I don't get it. That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.,8
Katara,"[  A moment passes. Sudden excitement.  ] Sokka, you're a genius!",8
Aang,[  Confused.  ] Wait. How is Sokka a genius? His plan didn't even work.,8
Sokka,[  Pleasantly.  ] Come on Aang. Let her dream.,8
Katara,You're right. Sokka's plan  didn't  work. But it  looks  like it did.,8
Aang,"[  Dubiously.  ] Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years? [  Katara grasps her chin, slyly grinning toward Aang.  ]",8
Shyu,[  Time skip. Fire Sages run toward Shyu in front of the door.  ] Come quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary!,8
Great Fire Sage,How did he get in?,8
Shyu,I don't know. But look at the scorch marks! And down there! [  Points to a shadow visible at the bottom of the door.  ],8
Great Fire Sage,"He's inside! Open the doors, immediately! Before he contacts Avatar Roku!",8
Great Fire Sage,It's the Avatar's lemur. He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!,8
Shyu,"[  Grabs the last free sage and hauls him into his grip, pinning him.  ] Now, Aang!",8
Katara,[  A moment of silence.  ] Aang! Now's your chance!,8
Zuko,"[  Steps out from behind column. Grips Aang from behind, pinning Aang's arms behind him.  ] The Avatar's coming with me! [  The captured sages use their captors' surprise to reclaim the upper hand, pinning their captors down. Momo flies off with the Great Fire Sage's hat.  ] Close the doors! Quickly!",8
Katara,[  Chained. Sees him coming toward her. Turns head toward the closing door.  ] Go!,8
Katara,[  Pleased.  ] He made it!,8
Aang,[  Stands. Confused.  ] The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?,8
Zuko,[  He and four sages launch fire blasts into the door's locks. Nothing happens. Frustrated.  ] Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!,8
Great Fire Sage,It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.,8
Aang,"[  Exasperated. Standing in the middle of the room, facing the statue.  ] Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please Avatar Roku, talk to me!",8
Roku,"It's good to see you Aang. What took you so long? [  Aang respectfully places a fist into his palm, bowing his head to the Avatar before him.  ]",8
Zuko,"[  Firmly to Shyu, who is kneeling before him with his hands behind his back.  ] Why did you help the Avatar?",8
Shyu,[  Sadly and proudly.  ] Because it was once the sages' duty. It is still our duty.,8
Zhao,"[  Claps. Interrupts interrogation. Approaches with six firebender guards.  ] What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand, when you explain why you betrayed him.",8
Great Fire Sage,[  Places palms together. Bows head forward.  ] Commander Zhao.,8
Zhao,"And Prince Zuko. It was a noble effort, but your little smokescreen didn't work. [  Zuko scowls sharply. Firebenders step behind him, seizing his arms.  ] Two traitors in one day, the Fire Lord  will  be pleased.",8
Zuko,"[  Strains against his captor, snaps at Zhao.  ] You're too late, Zhao! The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.",8
Zhao,"No matter. [  Grins confidently.  ] Sooner or later, he has to come out. [  Katara and Sokka share a worried glance.  ]",8
Roku,"I have something very important to tell you, Aang. That is why, when you were in the Spirit World, I sent my dragon to find you.",8
Aang,"[  Interested, curious.  ] Is it about that vision? The one of the comet?",8
Roku,Yes.,8
Aang,What does it mean?,8
Roku,"One hundred years ago, [  Viewers see a visual of a comet in the dark sky.  ] Fire Lord Sozin used that comet to begin the War. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power, and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.",8
Aang,[  Close-up.  ] So the comet made them stronger?,8
Roku,[  Close-up.  ] Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.,8
Aang,[  Close-up.  ] But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the War  now  ?,8
Roku,"Listen carefully. [  Viewers see silhouette of Fire Lord Ozai standing amid flames, fists taut.  ] Sozin's Comet will return by the end of this summer, and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the War, once and for all. [  Visual and audio of Ozai's silhouette roaring upward, fire streaming from his mouth.  ] If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang. You  must  defeat the Fire Lord, before the comet arrives.",8
Aang,[  Counters anxiously.  ] But I haven't even started learning waterbending! Not to mention earth and fire!,8
Roku,"Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end. [  Close-up of a shocked Aang.  ]",8
Zhao,"When those doors open, [  Shouts.  ] unleash all your firepower!",8
Katara,[  Worried.  ] How's Aang gonna make it out of this?,8
Sokka,"[  Troubled, questioning.  ] How are  we  gonna make it out of this?",8
Aang,[  Terrified.  ] What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?,8
Roku,"I know you can do it Aang. [  Close-up of half his face.  ] For you have done it before. [  Close-up of half of Aang's now-smiling face.  ] The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways, for now.",8
Aang,But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?,8
Roku,"I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way. [  Closes his eyes, providing Aang a vision of Fire Navy ships surrounding the island. Speaks to his mind without words.  ] A great danger awaits you at the temple. [  Provides a vision of the awaiting firebenders on the other side of the door.  ] I can help you face the threat. But only if you are ready.",8
Aang,[  Eyes and arrows glow.  ] I'm ready.,8
Zhao,"Ready ... [  Light fades, revealing a pair of glowing white eyes in the darkness.  ]",8
Katara,[  Sokka struggles against his chains. Katara is terrified.  ] No! Aang!,8
Zhao,Fire! [  He and his guards cooperate in blasting fire onto the unseen target.  ],8
Shyu,[  In awe.  ] Avatar Roku ...,8
Shyu,[  Implores.  ] Avatar Roku is going to destroy the temple! We  have  to get out of here!,8
Katara,Not  without Aang!,8
Sokka,"[  Aang sighs weakly and drops to his knees. Sokka and Katara approach Aang's sides, supportively lifting him back to his feet.  ] We got your back.",8
Aang,[  Weakly.  ] Thanks. Where's Shyu?,8
Katara,"[  Walking away with Sokka, helping Aang.  ] I don't know.",8
Zhao,"[  Turns angrily, snapping.  ] No  Prince  , no  Avatar  ! Apparently, the only thing I do have is five  traitors!",8
Great Fire Sage,[  Interjects.  ] But Commander! Only Shyu helped the Avatar.,8
Zhao,"[  Close-up.  ] Save your stories for the Fire Lord. As far as I'm concerned, you are all  guilty  ! [  Orders.  ] Take them to the prison hold!",8
Sokka,"[  Aang is pacing around on Appa's saddle, breathing heavily.  ] Would you sit down? [  Turns around from his perch on Appa's head.  ] If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off. What's bugging you anyway?",9
Aang,[  Worriedly.  ] It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.,9
Sokka,"[  In a sarcastic, amused tone while facing Aang.  ] Well, let's see. You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.",9
Aang,[  Frightfully.  ] I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole. What am I gonna do?,9
Katara,"[  Grabs Aang's arm.  ] Calm down, it's going to be okay. [  Aang sits down in front of her.  ] If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know.",9
Aang,[  Smiling.  ] You'd do that?,9
Katara,[  Nods and looks over the side of Appa's saddle.  ] We'll need to find a good source of water first.,9
Sokka,[  Grinning; sarcastically.  ] Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.,9
Sokka,[  Frowning beside Aang and Katara's ecstatic faces.  ] Nice puddle.,9
Aang,"[  Takes off his shirt, smiling.  ] Yeah! Don't start without me, boy! [  Begins to run toward the water.  ]",9
Katara,[  Somewhat blankly.  ] Remember the reason we're here.,9
Aang,[  Stops short and looks at Katara.  ] Oh right. Time to practice waterbending. [  Puts his clothes back on.  ],9
Sokka,[  Sarcastically.  ] Great. So what am I supposed to do?,9
Aang,You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes. [  Hands Sokka a branch with a bushel of leaves at the end.  ],9
Sokka,"[  Frowns and crosses his arms.  ] So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's feet?",9
Aang,[  Smiles; somewhat cheerfully.  ] Mud and bugs!,9
Sokka,Okay. [  Takes stick and walks over to Appa who is floating in the water.  ],9
Zuko,[  Close-up of his face; he glares at the tower.  ] Someone's changing our course.,9
Zuko,"[  Storming in, yelling.  ] What is the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course! [  Shows Iroh and the rest of the crew playing Pai Sho behind them.  ]",9
Iroh,"Actually, someone did. I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko. [  Scratches beard.  ]",9
Zuko,[  Hopefully.  ] Is it something to do with the Avatar?,9
Iroh,"Even more urgent. It seems, I- [  Rubs forehead in stress.  ] -I have lost my lotus tile. [  Moves a piece of his across the Pai Sho board.  ]",9
Zuko,[  Confused.  ] Lotus tile?,9
Iroh,"For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.",9
Zuko,[  In disbelief.  ] You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?,9
Iroh,"See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. [  Excitedly.  ] Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life. [  Zuko breathes fire up at the ceiling in anger and Iroh smiles.  ] I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.",9
Sokka,"Yeah, don't get too happy. You've got to do  me  next. [  Appa moans happily.  ]",9
Katara,"This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect. So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away. [  She moves her hands back and forth and makes small waves in the water, while Aang looks up, smiling.  ] Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement right.",9
Aang,"[  Stands up.  ] Like this? [  Does the hand movements Katara is doing, but nothing is happening yet.  ]",9
Katara,[  Kindly.  ] That's almost right. If you keep practicing I'm sure eventually—,9
Aang,"Hey, I'm bending it already! [  Shows Aang making much bigger waves than Katara's on his first try.  ]",9
Katara,"[  Surprised.  ] Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. It took me two months to learn that move.",9
Aang,"[  Shrugs shoulders.  ] Well, you had to figure it all on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.",9
Katara,[  Smiles.  ] Thanks.,9
Aang,"So, what's next?",9
Katara,"This is a more difficult move. I call it streaming the water. [  She moves her hands and raises a stream of water from the river into the air and moves it around.  ] It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if- [  Shows Aang already controlling a stream of water, moving it around and above his body and neatly coiling it back into the river, much to Katara's dismay.  ] Nice work. [  She frowns.  ] Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.",9
Aang,"Sorry. [  Excited.  ] Well, don't stop now! Keep 'em coming!",9
Katara,"[  Looks up sadly.  ] Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave. [  She moves her hands up, shaking, and starts to get a big mass of water to rise out of the river, but it pops before forming into anything substantial.  ]",9
Aang,"So, like this? [  He raises his hands and creates a massive wave that towers over their heads.  ]",9
Sokka,"[  Still working on cleaning up Appa, he looks up and stares at Aang's wave crashing toward him in fear.  ] Aang?! [  The wave throws Sokka off into the water and his head slowly rises out, annoyed.  ]",9
Aang,[  Smiling.  ] Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else do you got?,9
Katara,[  Angry at Aang's quick success.  ] That's enough practicing for today.,9
Sokka,"[  Head still sticking out of the water.  ] Yeah, I'll say! [  Points to the left.  ] You just ""practiced"" our supplies down the river. [  Shows a group of bags floating away.  ]",9
Aang,"[  Looking guilty.  ] Uh, sorry. [  Smiles worriedly.  ] I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.",9
Sokka,My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender. [  Sinks back underwater.  ],9
Sokka,[  Walking back from alleyway with a bag over his shoulders.  ] We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely.,9
Aang,"Uh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle! [  Pulls out a white whistle that looks like a bison, takes a huge breath and blows into it, but it barely makes a sound.  ]",9
Sokka,[  Pulls out fingers over his ears after expecting a loud noise.  ] It doesn't even work. [  Aang stops blowing when Momo squawks at him.  ] See? Even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.,9
Katara,"No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on. [  Aang hands her the two copper coins.  ]",9
Oh,"[  Moving hands and shouting excitedly.  ] Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation! So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here! Don't be shy, come on by! [  Sokka, Katara, and Aang walk by and he runs up to them.  ] Oh! You there, I can see from your clothing that you're world-traveling types. Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?",9
Aang,[  Walks back to the man.  ] Sure! What are curios?,9
Oh,"[  Looks confused and thinks.  ] I'm not entirely sure. But we got 'em! [  Puts his hand on Aang's shoulder and smiles, walking him into the ship.  ]",9
Aang,"[  Looks up close at an item on a shelf, confused.  ] Huh?",9
Pirate captain,"[  Standing in a dark doorway as Aang passes by with Momo on his back.  ] I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur. [  Walks into the light, an iguana parrot on his shoulder.  ] That beast would fetch me a hefty sum if you'd be interested in bartering. [  The iguana parrot squawks at them.  ]",9
Aang,[  Grabbing Momo.  ] Momo's not for sale.,9
Katara,"[  Smiling.  ] Look at this, Aang. It's a waterbending scroll! [  Aang walks over.  ] Check out these crazy moves.",9
Aang,"[  Turns to the captain, excited.  ] Where did you get a waterbending scroll?",9
Pirate captain,"[  Slams his hand onto the scroll and pulls it away.  ] Let's just say I got it up North, at a most reasonable price, free. [  Rolls the scroll back up and puts it away back in its shelf.  ]",9
Sokka,"[  Turns around and looks at the captain from the other side of the room.  ] Wait a minute ... Sea loving traders, with suspiciously acquired merchandise, [  Raises eyebrows, almost yelling.  ] and pet reptile birds? [  Turns around to Oh, almost spitting in his face.  ] You guys are pirates!",9
Oh,"[  Puts his arm around a terrified Sokka's shoulders.  ] We prefer to think of ourselves as ""high risk traders.""",9
Katara,"So, how much for the, uh,  traded  scroll?",9
Pirate captain,"I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom. [  Voice turns less serious.  ] Unless of course, you kids have two hundred gold pieces on you right now.",9
Aang,"[  Turns around and whispers to Katara.  ] I know how to deal with these guys, Katara. Pirates love to haggle. [  Katara drops the final coins in his hand.  ] Watch and learn. [  Walks over to the counter, leans against it, and talks in a pirate voice.  ] Let's say to the price of, one copper piece! [  Smiles, and dramatically presents the single coin.  ]",9
Pirate captain,[  Laughs hysterically.  ] The price is two hundred gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare.,9
Aang,"[  Still smirking and talking like a pirate.  ] Okay, two copper pieces!",9
Pirate captain,"[  Aggravated.  ] It's not as amusing the second time, boy!",9
Katara,"[  Whispering.  ] Aang, can we get out of here? I feel like we're getting weird looks.",9
Aang,"Aye, we be casting off now! [  Walks away.  ]",9
Aang,"What was that all about, Katara?",9
Sokka,"Yeah, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.",9
Katara,"[  Worried, holding her arms.  ] I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.",9
Oh,Hey you! Get back here!,9
Aang,"[  Calmly turns around.  ] Well, well. Look who's come to their senses. Told you the haggling would pay off.",9
Katara,"[  Scared.  ] I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us. [  Turns around and runs, Aang and Sokka follow and the pirates chase behind them. Half of the group runs down one street while the other goes down the one next to it.  ]",9
Oh,This way. Let's cut 'em off!,9
Sokka,[  Turning a corner with Aang and Katara.  ] Whoa! [  Katara freezes a puddle behind them that a pirate slips on.  ],9
Cabbage merchant,[  Angry.  ] My cabbages! This place is worse than Omashu!,9
Pirate,I hope that lemur of yours has nine lives!,9
Oh,"[  Him and the pirates corner them in the dead end of a street.  ] Now, who gets to taste the steel of my blade first?",9
Aang,"No thanks. [  Spins and hurls a blast of air at the pirates that send them backward, and runs toward them with his glider out.  ] Grab on tight!",9
Katara,Aang! I thought we were running  away  from the pirates! [  Jumps on to Aang's glider with Sokka and they lift off into the air.  ],9
Aang,Just hang on! [  Flies over the pirates' heads and into the distance.  ],9
Aang,"[  Putting his glider away.  ] I used to kind of look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.",9
Katara,[  Mischievously.  ] I know. That's why I took this. [  Holds out the waterbending scroll they saw in the shop.  ],9
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] No way!,9
Katara,[  Excited.  ] Isn't it great?,9
Sokka,No wonder they were trying to hack us up! You stole their waterbending scroll!,9
Katara,[  Jokingly.  ] I prefer to think of it as high risk trading.,9
Aang,"[  Laughs.  ] Good one, Katara.",9
Katara,"Sokka, where do you think  they  got it? They stole it from a waterbender!",9
Sokka,"It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes.",9
Katara,These are  real  waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending!,9
Sokka,[  Walks away.  ] Whatever.,9
Aang,"Well, what's done is done. We have it, we might as well learn from it.",9
Iroh,I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.,9
Zuko,It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time  for everyone  !,9
Iroh,"Quite the contrary. I always say, the only thing better than finding something you are looking for [  Crew members begin to walk past carrying Iroh's purchases.  ] is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain! [  A crew member walks past the two playing a tsungi horn.  ]",9
Zuko,You bought a tsungi horn?,9
Iroh,"For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds. [  Pointing to the ship.  ] Oh, this place looks promising! [  The monkey statue is shown again.  ] Oh, that is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?",9
Oh,[  To pirate captain.  ] We lost the Water Tribe girl and the little bald monk she was traveling with.,9
Zuko,"[  Turning.  ] This monk, did he have an arrow on his head? [  Iroh turns around, making a face similar to the monkey's.  ]",9
Katara,"I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours. [  Gives it to Aang.  ] Here, hold it open for me. The single water whip. Looks doable. [  Attempts the move, but ends up hitting herself in the forehead.  ] Ow!",9
Sokka,"Ha, ha, ha!",9
Katara,[  Glaring at Sokka.  ] What's so funny?,9
Sokka,"I'm sorry, but you deserved that. [  To Aang.  ] You've been duped; she's only interested in teaching herself.",9
Katara,"[  Angrily.  ] Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip. [  She tries again, but hits Momo instead, who screeches.  ] Ugh, why can't I get this stupid move?",9
Aang,"You'll get it. [  Katara glares at him.  ] You just gotta shift your weight through the stances. [  He tries and does it perfectly on the first try.  ] There, see, the key to bending is—",9
Katara,"[  Screaming.  ] Will you please shut your air hole? [  Frustrated.  ] Believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes! Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted! [  Sokka glares at her.  ] What? [  She looks back at Aang, giving him a disgusted look, who has tears in his eyes.  ] Oh my gosh, Aang, I am so sorry, I don't know what came over me. But you know what, it won't happen again. [  She gives the scroll to Aang.  ] Here, this is yours. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.",9
Aang,It's okay Katara.,9
Sokka,What about Momo? He's the real victim here.,9
Katara,"[  Bends down to pet Momo as he rubs his hind end.  ] I'm sorry, Momo.",9
Sokka,And what about me? There was that time you—,9
Katara,No more apologies!,9
Pirate captain,Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?,9
Zuko,"We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right?",9
Pirate captain,Mm-hm.,9
Zuko,Then they'll be on the water.,9
Katara,"[  Whispering.  ] Shhh, Momo! Go back to sleep. Shh! [  The camera fades to show her standing by the river, attempting but failing to perfect the water whip, frustrated.  ] Ugh, ugh, ugh! Shoot! Come on water, work with me here! Okay, what if I just, ow! Stupid scroll! [  The pirate captain and Zuko are shown hearing her.  ] Okay Katara, shift your weight through the stances. [  She drops the water again and hears the ship pulling up onto the river bank. She peaks through the bushes to see what the noise was, and gasps upon seeing the pirates. She turns to run, but it grabbed by a pirate.  ] No! Let go of me! [  She bends water up into the pirate's face, and he releases her, she runs but is grabbed again on the wrists by Zuko.  ]",9
Zuko,[  He glares at her as she looks frightfully at him.  ] I'll save you from the pirates.,9
Zuko,Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother.,9
Katara,[  Furiously.  ] Go jump in the river!,9
Zuko,"Try to understand. I need to capture him to restore something I've lost, my honor. [  Katara jerks her head away from Zuko.  ] Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost. [  He holds her mother's necklace up to her neck.  ]",9
Katara,My mother's necklace! How did you get that?,9
Zuko,"I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering.  Tell me  where he is. [  Points at Katara.  ]",9
Katara,No!,9
Pirate captain,Enough of this necklace garbage! You promised a scroll!,9
Zuko,"I wonder how much this is worth ... [  The pirates gasp as he takes it out and holds it over a fire in his hand.  ] A lot, apparently. Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back, and everyone goes home happy. Search the woods for the boy and meet back here!",9
Pirate captain,Fine.,9
Sokka,[  Notices Katara's missing.  ] Huh? Where did she go? [  Looks through the bag.  ] I don't believe it.,9
Aang,[  Yawns.  ] What's wrong?,9
Sokka,She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing. It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep- [  Yells as a pirate throws a rope around his arms and drags him forward. He rolls away and charges at the pirate while another pirate captures Aang in a net and drags him away.  ],9
Pirate,"I got him, come on!",9
Sokka,"Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap? Ah! [  The pirate shoots another net at Sokka and drags him away too.  ]",9
Zuko,Nice work.,9
Katara,"Aang, this is all  my  fault.",9
Aang,"No Katara, it isn't.",9
Iroh,"Yeah, it kind of is. [  Katara glares at Iroh.  ]",9
Zuko,[  To the pirate captain.  ] Give me the boy.,9
Pirate captain,You  give  us  the scroll.,9
Sokka,You're really gonna hand over  the Avatar  for a stupid piece of parchment?,9
Zuko,"Don't listen to him, he's trying to turn us against each other!",9
Pirate captain,[  Turns to Aang.  ] Your friend is the Avatar?,9
Sokka,"Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market than that fancy scroll.",9
Zuko,"Shut your mouth, you Water Tribe peasant!",9
Aang,"Yeah, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth.",9
Sokka,I'm just sayin' it's bad business sense. Think how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life.,9
Pirate captain,[  To Zuko.  ] Keep the scroll; we can buy a hundred with the reward we'll get for the kid. [  The pirates turn to leave.  ],9
Zuko,"You'll regret breaking a deal with me. [  He and two of his soldiers send a blast of fire at the pirates. The pirates jump back and Oh runs out, throwing smoke bombs and jumping into the cloud as the fight ensues. Some of the soldiers run out to Sokka and Aang, who are struggling with their ropes, but are stopped by several pirates. Momo runs down the tree and frees Katara.  ]",9
Katara,"Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples. [  She runs to join the fight. Aang is shown lost in the smoke, a thrown knife narrowly misses him and cuts through his ropes. Zuko finds his way out of the smoke cloud and hides the scroll behind his back, but the pirate captain sees him and the two begin to fight. The scroll flies into the air and his caught by Momo, the iguana parrot sees him and hits Momo. The scroll flies back down to the ground. A knife narrowly misses Sokka's head, and he uses it to cuts the ropes on his hands.  ]",9
Sokka,"[  Shouting.  ] Aang, are you there?",9
Aang,I'm over here! Follow my voice!,9
Sokka,Where? I can't find you!,9
Aang,"I'm right here! [  Airbends the dust away, revealing the pirates surrounding him, and immediately airbends it back around himself.  ] Uh, never mind! I'll find you! [  Sokka climbs out of the dust cloud on his hands and knees. Aang vaults over him in a full sprint.  ] Run! [  They find Katara, who is trying to push the pirate boat back into the water.  ] Katara, you're okay!",9
Katara,"Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get outta here. [  They join her in trying to push the boat, but can't.  ]",9
Sokka,We'd need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.,9
Aang,"A team of rhinos, or two waterbenders.",9
Katara,Everybody in!,9
Iroh,Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?,9
Zuko,"We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle!",9
Iroh,It's no proverb! [  Points to Team Avatar who has hijacked the pirate ship.  ],9
Pirate captain,Bleeding hog monkeys! [  Zuko laughs while pointing at him. His laughter dissipates as the pirates hijack his own boat. The pirates taunt him and the screen pans to a steaming Zuko.  ],9
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] Hey! That's  my  boat! [  Goes chasing after the hijacked boat.  ],9
Iroh,[  Pondering.  ] Maybe it should be a proverb ...,9
Zuko,"[  Off camera.  ] C'mon, Uncle! [  Iroh runs after Zuko.  ]",9
Aang,"Sokka, can't you make it go any faster?",9
Sokka,I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the Water Tribe!,9
Aang,"Hey, you did the water whip!",9
Katara,I couldn't have done it without your help.,9
Sokka,Would you two quit congratulating each other and help me out?,9
Oh,That's good ... [  Aang lands behind him and airbends him and the other pirate off the ship before jumping down to Sokka.  ],9
Katara,"[  Pointing.  ] Aang, look! [  The ship is shown headed toward a huge waterfall.  ]",9
Aang,Oh no ...,9
Sokka,Have you lost your mind? This is no time for flute practice! [  Katara and Aang stare in horror at the approaching waterfall.  ],9
Katara,"We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water! [  They create a small Whirlpool that stops the boat.  ] It's working, it's slowing down! We're doing it!",9
Sokka,"But we have another problem. [  Zuko's boat is shown sailing straight toward their ship. The boat rams into the ship and Sokka, Aang, and Katara are forced to jump as the boat goes over the falls.  ]",9
Together,Jump! [  Appa is shown flying toward them. They land on him and fly to safety.  ],9
Aang,[  Holding up the whistle.  ] I knew a bison whistle would come in handy! Thanks Appa.,9
Sokka,"Yeah, we owe you one. [  Appa roars and the scene cuts to show Zuko running to the cliff in horror at the fact that his boat has gone over the falls.  ]",9
Zuko,My boat!,9
Iroh,"[  Chuckles.  ] Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this. That lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time! [  Has a big smile on his face.  ]",9
Katara,"Aang, I still owe you an apology. You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger, I'm sorry.",9
Aang,That's okay Katara.,9
Katara,"Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway?",9
Sokka,[  Holding the scroll. Sarcastically.  ] Is that really how you feel?,9
Katara,The scroll!,9
Sokka,"[  Puts his hand in front to keep Katara from grabbing it.  ] First, what did you learn?",9
Katara,Stealing is wrong. [  Snatches scroll.  ] Unless it's from pirates.,9
Aang,"[  Laughing.  ] Good one, Katara.",9
Aang,"Where's Momo? [  Camera zooms in to close-up shot of Aang, Katara, and Sokka, the siblings sitting next to each other with bored faces, and Aang standing with his back to the camera. Momo screeches and the gang looks around.  ]",10
Aang,"Hang on, Momo! [  Aang uses his airbending to fly to the top of the tree, jumping from trunk-to-trunk to get higher. He finds the traps' mechanisms, undoes them, and carefully lowers Momo to the ground where Katara and Sokka are waiting. They open the trap together and the lemur runs out with one of the lychee nuts in his mouth. Katara and Sokka look on as Momo gets on his hind legs and eats it as though nothing has happened. Sokka grunts in frustration and facepalms. When Aang lands, he looks up to see the other two animals seemingly crying out to him for help.  ] All right, you too. [  Jumps up to them.  ]",10
Sokka,This is gonna take forever. [  Throws his boomerang to simply cut the animals free.  ],10
Aang,[  Inching his way upside-down to the traps on the tree branch. They fall before he can reach them.  ] That works.,10
Sokka,"These are Fire Nation traps, [  Camera zooms to upward shot of the gang looking at the trap.  ] you can tell from the metalwork. We better pack up camp, and get moving.",10
Sokka,Uh uh. No flying this time.,10
Aang,[  Confused.  ] What? Why wouldn't we fly?,10
Sokka,"[  Takes the sleeping bag from Aang's hands.  ] Think about it: Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa, he's just too noticeable.",10
Katara,What? Appa's not too noticeable!,10
Sokka,[  Points dramatically at Appa; condescendingly.  ] He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head! It's kinda hard to miss him! [  The bison yawns and the camera flashes to Aang sitting comfortably on the animal's head.  ],10
Aang,[  To Appa.  ] Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow.,10
Sokka,"[  Camera closes in on Sokka and Katara next to each other.  ] I know you all wanna fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk.",10
Katara,[  Leans forward at her brother and smiles.  ] Who made you the boss?,10
Sokka,"[  Points his finger at his chest; to Katara.  ] I'm not the boss, I'm the leader.",10
Katara,[  Amused.  ] You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!,10
Sokka,"[  Voice cracks.  ] I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior, so [  Deepens voice.  ] I'm the leader!",10
Katara,"[  Close-up shot of Katara's face.  ] If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean he  is  the Avatar. [  Pan back to Sokka.  ]",10
Sokka,"Are you kidding, he's just a goofy kid!",10
Aang,[  While hanging upside-down from Appa's right horn with feet sticking out in the air.  ] He's right.,10
Katara,Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.,10
Sokka,"[  Close-up on Sokka; defensively.  ] I've kissed a girl, you just haven't met her.",10
Katara,[  Back to Sokka.  ] Who? Gran-Gran? I've met Gran-Gran.,10
Sokka,"[  Throws arms into the air.  ] No! Besides Gran-Gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot, and a leader has to trust his instincts.",10
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Okay, we'll try it your way, oh wise leader.",10
Aang,"[  Aang steps over, now wearing a backpack. Momo is sitting on the top.  ] Who knows? Walking might be fun. [  Cut to the forest at a later time. Between trees the group trudges along, with Sokka in front, followed by Aang and Momo, Katara, and Appa.  ] Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?",10
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Well I don't know, Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts? They seem to know everything.",10
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Ha, ha, very funny.",10
Aang,[  Complaining.  ] I'm tired of carrying this pack.,10
Katara,You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's instincts. [  Sokka's eyes turn to her in irritation.  ],10
Aang,"That's a great idea. Hey, Sokka's instincts, would you mind-",10
Sokka,"[  Annoyed.  ] Okay, okay, I get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that we're safe from the [  Walks through a bush and sees something in front of him.  ] Fire ... Nation.",10
Sokka,Run! [  They turn to run but a firebender blocks them off by setting the plants behind them on fire.  ] We're cut off!,10
Aang,"Sokka, your shirt! [  Sokka yells; Katara clears a fire on Sokka's shirt with waterbending.  ]",10
Sokka,"If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.",10
Katara,[  Whispers.  ] What are you doing?,10
Sokka,[  Whispers.  ] Bluffing?,10
Eye-patch soldier,You  promise not to hurt  us  ? [  He's somehow knocked out.  ],10
Aang,"Nice work, Sokka! How'd you do that?",10
Sokka,"Uh, instinct?",10
Katara,[  Points up a tree.  ] Look!,10
Jet,"Down you go. [  Katara looks amazed, Aang shocked, and Sokka confused.  ]",10
Fire Nation soldier,They're in the trees!,10
Sokka,"Hey, he was mine!",10
Jet,Gotta be quicker next time.,10
Sokka,[  Angrily.  ] Man!,10
Jet,Hey.,10
Katara,Hi.,10
Aang,[  Amazed.  ] You just took out a whole army almost single-handed.,10
Sokka,"[  Disdainfully.  ] Army? There were only like, twenty guys.",10
Jet,"My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters, Sneers, Longshot, Smellerbee, The Duke, and Pipsqueak.",10
Aang,"[  Laughing; looking at The Duke.  ] Ha, ha, Pipsqueak, that's a funny name. [  The Duke sniffs his nose, as the camera pans upward to Pipsqueak.  ]",10
Pipsqueak,"[  Looming over Aang in a threatening manner; in a low, growling tone of voice.  ] You think my name is funny?",10
Aang,[  Side-shot; Aang looks taken aback for a second before replying in an upbeat tone.  ] It's hilarious!,10
Katara,"[  Approaching Jet.  ] Umm, thanks for saving us Jet. We're lucky you were there.",10
Jet,"I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning, we just needed the right distraction, and then you guys stumbled in.",10
Katara,[  Eyeing Sokka.  ] We were relying on instincts.,10
Jet,You'll get yourself killed doing that.,10
The Duke,"Hey Jet, these barrels are filled of blasting jelly.",10
Jet,That's a great score.,10
Pipsqueak,And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!,10
Jet,"Also good, let's not get those mixed up.",10
The Duke,We'll take this stuff back to the hideout.,10
Aang,You guys have a hideout?,10
Jet,You wanna see it?,10
Katara,"[  Very excitedly.  ] Yes, we wanna see it!",10
Jet,We're here.,10
Sokka,Where? There's nothing here.,10
Jet,Hold this. [  Gives a rope to Sokka.  ],10
Sokka,[  Skeptically.  ] Why? What's this do? [  Screams as he is pulled up into the branches.  ],10
Jet,Aang? [  Offers Aang another rope.  ],10
Aang,I'll get up on my own. [  Leaps up into the trees with airbending.  ],10
Jet,"Grab hold of me, Katara.",10
Aang,[  While passing through with Momo.  ] Nice place you got!,10
Katara,It's beautiful up here!,10
Jet,It's beautiful ... and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us. [  Smellerbee lands near the two.  ],10
Smellerbee,"They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet?",10
Jet,"It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee.",10
Katara,[  As Aang zips by again.  ] Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?,10
Jet,"I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble. See, they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back.",10
Pipsqueak,"We've been ambushin' their troops, cutting off their supply lines, and doing anything we can to mess with 'em. [  Sokka is now seen comically hopping around trying to get past Pipsqueak.  ]",10
Jet,"One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free that town.",10
Katara,That's so brave. [  Sokka manages to get by Pipsqueak.  ],10
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a tree house.",10
Katara,Don't pay any attention to my brother.,10
Jet,No problem. He probably had a rough day.,10
Katara,"So, you all live here? [  Sokka who is being ignored comically sinks back behind them.  ]",10
Jet,That's right. Longshot over there? [  The screen cuts to Longshot and The Duke walking not making a sound.  ] His town got burned down by the Fire Nation. And we found The Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.,10
Katara,What about you?,10
Jet,[  Katara and Jet come to a halt as the rest pass.  ] The Fire Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.,10
Katara,Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.,10
Jet,"I'm so sorry, Katara.",10
Jet,"Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine. [  Everyone cheers. Katara and Aang smile while Sokka cops an attitude and a scowling face.  ] I got a special joy from the look on one soldier's face, when The Duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey. [  The Duke, without his helmet, climbs up the table. He marches on the table with his arms in the air.  ] Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don't have to worry about a couple of kids hiding in the trees. [  He prepares to take a drink from his wooden cup.  ] Maybe they're right. [  A very loud and long boo is heard; with an angry face.  ] Or maybe ... they're  dead  wrong. [  A loud and long cheer is heard.  ]",10
Katara,"Hey Jet, nice speech.",10
Jet,"Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang. That was some great bending I saw out there today.",10
Katara,"Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. [  Blushes.  ] I could use some more training.",10
Jet,Avatar huh?  Very  nice.,10
Aang,Thanks Jet.,10
Jet,So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.,10
Sokka,"Unfortunately, we have to leave tonight. [  Sokka starts walking away.  ]",10
Jet,"Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow. [  Sokka turns around.  ]",10
Sokka,What mission?,10
Jet,What are you doing?,10
Sokka,Shh ... It amplifies vibrations.,10
Jet,[  Impressed.  ] Good trick.,10
Sokka,"[  Sokka puts his ear to the handle of his knife.  ] Nothing yet. [  Whispers.  ] Wait! Yes, someone's approaching.",10
Jet,[  Whispers.  ] How many?,10
Sokka,I think there's just one.,10
Jet,"[  Does a another birdcall.  ] Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon. [  Sokka takes his knife out of the tree. His eyes spot an old man.  ]",10
Sokka,"[  Whispers.  ] Wait, false alarm ... He's just an old man.",10
Jet,"What are you doing in our woods, you leech?",10
Old Fire Nation civilian,"Please sir, I'm just a traveler.",10
Jet,Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you?,10
Old Fire Nation civilian,Oh ... Please let me go ... have mercy ...,10
Jet,Does the Fire Nation let people go? Does the Fire Nation have mercy?,10
Sokka,"Jet, he's just an old man!",10
Jet,He's Fire Nation! Search him! [  Pipsqueak holds the prisoner and Smellerbee steps up to search the poor man.  ],10
Sokka,But he's not hurting anyone!,10
Jet,Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!,10
Smellerbee,"We've got his stuff, Jet. [  She holds up the old man's bag. The old man is thrown back on the ground.  ]",10
Sokka,This doesn't feel right.,10
Jet,"It's what has to be done, now let's get outta here.",10
Jet,"Come on, Sokka!",10
Aang,"Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me! [  Aang is wearing a bag and pulls a small pellet from it. With a sly grin, he tosses it next to Momo, where it explodes with a pop. Momo puffs up like a startled cat. He hisses and lunges for the bag. Momo sits on Aang's shoulder and tosses several pellets at his feet. Aang dances about wildly.  ] Ow! Quit it!",10
Katara,"Hey, Sokka. Is Jet back?",10
Sokka,Yeah he's back. But we're leaving.,10
Aang,What?,10
Katara,But I made him this hat. [  She shows a cap made out of stitched leaves with a flower on top.  ],10
Sokka,Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.,10
Katara,"What? No, he's not.",10
Sokka,He's messed up Katara.,10
Aang,"He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life, a really fun way of life.",10
Sokka,He beat and robbed a harmless old man!,10
Katara,I wanna hear Jet's side of the story. [  The scene changes to Jet in a room.  ],10
Jet,"Sokka, you told them what happened, but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?",10
Katara,"No, he conveniently left that part out.",10
Sokka,"Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian!",10
Jet,"He was an assassin, Sokka.",10
Jet,"See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife. [  He pulls on the ring and removes a small glass tube filled with red liquid.  ]. He was sent to eliminate me; you helped save my life, Sokka.",10
Katara,I knew there was an explanation.,10
Sokka,I didn't see any knife!,10
Jet,That's because he was concealing it.,10
Katara,"See, Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.",10
Sokka,There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things. [  Sokka stomps away.  ],10
Jet,Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help.,10
Aang,What can we do?,10
Jet,"The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both use waterbending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires. But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley.",10
Katara,We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!,10
Sokka,"I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.",10
Katara,You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!,10
Sokka,"Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct—",10
Katara,Well  my  instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang.,10
Aang,"Sorry, Sokka.",10
Jet,Let's go.,10
Jet,"Now listen, you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive. [  The Duke jumps off the wagon.  ]",10
The Duke,"But what about the people in the town, won't they get wiped out too? [  Jet places a hand on The Duke's shoulder.  ]",10
Jet,"Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation. [  To Longshot.  ] Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal—got it? [  Longshot nods.  ]",10
Smellerbee,"[  Sneering.  ] Where do you think you're going, ponytail?",10
Jet,"Sokka, I'm glad you decided to join us. [  Pipsqueak and Smellerbee send Sokka to his knees. He rubs his shoulder.  ]",10
Sokka,I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.,10
Jet,Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.,10
Sokka,"There are people living there, Jet; mothers and fathers and children.",10
Jet,We can't win without making some sacrifices. [  Sokka points an accusing finger at Jet.  ],10
Sokka,You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!,10
Jet,Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do.,10
Sokka,I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.,10
Jet,"I was hoping you'd have an open mind, but I can see you've made your choice.",10
Jet,"I can't let you warn Katara and Aang. [  Jet releases Sokka's hand; it is immediately forced behind his back.  ] Take him for a walk, a long walk.",10
Sokka,You can't do this!,10
Jet,"Cheer up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today.",10
Katara,"Jet, I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting.",10
Jet,"No worries, he already apologized.",10
Aang,Really? [  Aang and Katara stop and look at one another.  ] Sokka apologized?,10
Jet,"Yeah, I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something.",10
Katara,"Yeah, I did.",10
Jet,"I guess something you said got through to him. Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.",10
Katara,I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes.,10
Jet,"All right, we're here. Underground water's trying to escape through these vents. I need you guys to help it along.",10
Katara,I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know ... [  Jet stands behind her and places his hands on her shoulders.  ],10
Jet,Katara. You can do this.,10
Aang,[  Airbends himself back on the ground.  ] What about me?,10
Jet,I know the Avatar can do this.,10
Jet,Yes! Good job! This river empties into the reservoir--a few more geysers and it'll be full.,10
Aang,"Look, there's another steam vent. [  Aang and Katara walk off in its direction.  ]",10
Jet,"Okay. You two keep it up, I'll go check on things at the reservoir. [  He turns and walks away.  ]",10
Katara,When we're done we'll meet you over there.,10
Jet,Actually ... probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when you're done. [  Jet resumes walking away Aang and Katara bend the next geyser into another fountain.  ],10
Aang,"[  Later.  ] I bet that's enough, and I'm not just saying that to be lazy. [  Around them, over a dozen geysers flow into the river.  ]",10
Katara,Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir.,10
Aang,I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.,10
Katara,"Well, we finished early. I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.",10
Smellerbee,"Come on, move along!",10
Sokka,How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?,10
Pipsqueak,"Hey listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader. We follow what he says, and things always turn out okay. [  Sokka notices a couple of snare leaf-piles nearby identical to the one that enticed Momo, right down to the pile of nuts.  ]",10
Sokka,"If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn. [  Sokka sprints off in the direction of the snares. Smellerbee makes a grab for him, but misses.  ]",10
Smellerbee,"Hey! [  They give chase. Sokka leaps over the leaf piles. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee don't, and end up snared and hanging many feet up in the air.  ]",10
Sokka,"While you two are up there, you might want to practice your knot work. [  He holds up his now-worthless bindings, turns, and walks away.  ]",10
Pipsqueak,"Hey Smellerbee, you gonna eat your lychee nuts? [  Smellerbee hits him in the head with a lychee nut and it lands in the pile he's holding.  ] Ooh. [  He picks one up and licks his lips.  ]",10
Katara,What are they doing?,10
Aang,"Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.",10
Katara,"Why would they need blasting jelly? [  Zooms on Aang, who is horrified.  ]",10
Aang,Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam.,10
Katara,"What? No, that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that. [  Aang opens his glider.  ]",10
Aang,I've gotta stop him. [  He takes off.  ],10
Katara,[  Less convinced.  ] Jet wouldn't do that.,10
Jet,Yes I would.,10
Katara,"Jet, why?",10
Jet,"Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother, we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.",10
Katara,This isn't the answer!,10
Jet,"I want you to understand me Katara. I thought your brother would understand, but—",10
Katara,Where's Sokka? [  Tears fall from her eyes. Jet reaches out and touches her face.  ],10
Jet,Katara.,10
Aang,I need to get to the dam.,10
Jet,You're not going anywhere without your glider.,10
Aang,"I'm not gonna fight you, Jet.",10
Jet,[  Taunting.  ] You'll have to if you want your glider back.,10
Katara,"Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me, you're sick and I trusted you! [  A birdcall is heard. Katara and Aang are startled, and look to the valley beyond where it's coming from. Jet gives an answering birdcall.  ] What are you doing?",10
Jet,You're too late.,10
Katara,[  Horrified.  ] No!,10
Aang,"[  In pain from the fall.  ] Sokka's still out there, he's our only chance.",10
Katara,"Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, please.",10
Katara,[  Whispers.  ] No ...,10
Aang,Sokka didn't make it in time.,10
Katara,"All those people ... [  She turns in rage back to Jet.  ] Jet, you monster!",10
Jet,"This was a victory, Katara. Remember that. The Fire Nation is gone and this valley will be safe.",10
Sokka,"It will be safe, without you. [  In shock, Jet looks up to see Sokka, Appa, and Momo rise from below the level of the cliff.  ]",10
Katara,Sokka!,10
Sokka,"I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.",10
Jet,What?!,10
Sokka,"[  Cuts to an illustrated set of flashback stills each being panned through.  ] At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy. But one man vouched for me, the old man you attacked. He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time. [  The flashback ends and the townsfolk are seen on high ground above the river, on the bank opposite the town. A little girl, who was seen in the flashback, runs down to the water's edge as the doll floats by. She retrieves it.  ]",10
Little girl,[  Happily.  ] Misses Pretty! [  She hugs her doll.  ],10
Jet,"Sokka, you fool! We could've freed this valley!",10
Sokka,Who would be free? Everyone would be dead.,10
Jet,You traitor!,10
Sokka,"No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.",10
Jet,"Katara. Please, help me.",10
Katara,Goodbye Jet. [  Sokka gives Appa's reigns a flick.  ],10
Sokka,"Yip yip. [  Jet is left behind, still frozen to the tree.  ]",10
Aang,We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead?,10
Katara,"Let me guess, your instincts told you.",10
Sokka,"[  Shrugs his right shoulder.  ] Hey, sometimes they're right.",10
Aang:,"Um ... Sokka? You know we're going the wrong way, right? [  Sokka is surprised, but quickly recovers.  ]",10
Sokka,"And sometimes they're wrong. [  With a grin, he pulls Appa's reigns. They fly off screen before reappearing, going in the opposite direction.  ]",10
Katara,"Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?",11
Sokka,"Right, got it ... [  Tosses the wrapped up tarp inside the tent.  ]",11
Katara,"Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp  on top  of the tent. You know, so we don't get rained on? [  Cut to an overhead shot of the two, Sokka gesturing widely as he replies to his sister.  ]",11
Sokka,"Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.",11
Katara,But what if it does rain?,11
Sokka,[  Spreading his arms wide in exasperation.  ] What if it doesn't? Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing.,11
Katara,[  Stomps the ground angrily.  ] You're infuriating!,11
Sokka,"Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is looking pretty sorry.",11
Katara,"[  Angered.  ] Well, if you don't like my firewood- [  Throws the sticks at Sokka who shields himself from the wood. He stands in anger after the hail of sticks subsides.  ]",11
Sokka,"[  Angry.  ] Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job- [  He tears the tent down and the two stare at each other angrily as Aang approaches.  ]",11
Aang,"Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the- [  The siblings turn away from each other in anger with their arms folded.  ] hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?",11
Sokka,"Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs.",11
Katara,"Oh yeah? Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the [  Picks up and throws a twig at Sokka's head.  ] Tents! [  Sokka turns around, looking angrily at her.  ]",11
Aang,"[  Laughs.  ] Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?",11
Katara,Sounds good.,11
Sokka,[  At the same time.  ] Whatever.,11
Aang,"[  Grinning while gloating.  ] You see that? Settling feuds and making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar. [  Turns his head to see Momo and Appa fighting over a watermelon. Momo continuously tries to fly away with it, while Appa pins it down. Aang takes the melon and uses airbending to slice it. Momo seems to be complaining about how he got the much smaller half and Appa got the bigger half.  ] Come on, Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs. [  Appa eats his half of the melon.  ]",11
Aang,"There it is, guys, The Great Divide.",11
Katara,"[  In awe.  ] Wow, I could just stare at it forever. [  Zoom backward to show Sokka in the foreground.  ]",11
Sokka,"Okay, I've seen enough.",11
Katara,How can you not be fascinated Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.,11
Sokka,Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.,11
Gan Jin tribesman,"[  Shoving past Sokka.  ] If you're looking for the canyon guide, I was here first!",11
Katara,"Ooh, canyon guide? Sounds informative.",11
Gan Jin tribesman,"Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender, [  Oblivious to the fact that Sokka is behind him, mocking him.  ] and the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help, and he's taking  my  tribe across next.",11
Sokka,"Calm down, we know you're next.",11
Gan Jin tribesman,You wouldn't be so calm if the Fire Nation destroyed  your  home and forced  you  to flee! My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se.,11
Katara,You're a refugee!,11
Gan Jin tribesman,"Huh, tell me something I don't know.",11
Katara,Is that your tribe?,11
Gan Jin tribesman,"It most certainly is not! That's the Zhang tribe, a bunch of low-life thieves. They've been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years. [  Whistles to them.  ] Hey, Zhangs! I'm saving a spot for my tribe so don't even think about stealing it!",11
Zhang leader,Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their camp site?,11
Gan Jin tribesman,"Yes, but they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.",11
Zhang leader,I didn't know the canyon guide took reservations.,11
Gan Jin tribesman,"Ha, of course you didn't! That's the ignorance I'd expect from  a messy Zhang.  So unorganized and ill-prepared for a journey. [  The Zhang tribe members yell out in protest behind them. Katara and Aang look at each other worriedly, but turn around to see a large pile of rocks being levitated up and thrown away. The canyon guide stands behind where the rocks used to be.  ]",11
Canyon guide,"Sorry about the wait, youngsters. Who's ready to cross this here canyon?",11
Katara,"Uh, one of them, I think. [  Camera pans left to reveal the Zhang and the scout.  ]",11
Gan Jin tribesman,"[  Rushing forward.  ] I was here first, my party's on their way.",11
Canyon guide,I can't guide people who aren't here. [  Cut to a wider shot showing the Zhang filing past the three kids and the fuming Gan Jin scout.  ],11
Zhang leader,[  Mockingly.  ] Guess you guys will have to make the trip tomorrow.,11
Gan Jin tribesman,"Wait, here they come! [  A group of clean, finely dressed people are shown coming toward them.  ]",11
Zhang leader,[  To the canyon guide.  ] You're not seriously gonna cave into these spoiled Gan Jins? I mean we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need shelter.,11
Canyon guide,I ... uh ... well ...,11
Gan Jin tribesman,We've got old people who are weary from traveling.,11
Zhang leader,Sick people get priority over old people.,11
Gan Jin leader,Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs.,11
Zhang leader,"If you Gan Jins weren't so  clean  , you wouldn't live to be so  old.",11
Katara,"[  Over the two arguing tribes.  ] Well Aang, ready to put your peace-making skills to the test?",11
Aang,"I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding for a hundred years.",11
Katara,"[  Stepping forward.  ] Everybody listen up! This is the Avatar, and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.",11
Aang,"Uh, you could  share  the earthbender and travel together?",11
Gan Jin leader,Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those stinking thieves!,11
Zhang leader,We wouldn't travel with those pompous fools anyway! [  The two tribes begin to shout at each other again.  ],11
Aang,"[  Shouting.  ] All right here's the deal, you're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across! Does that seem fair? [  Both leaders nod in agreement, and the scene fades to show the sick and elderly boarding Appa.  ]",11
Aang,"[  To Appa.  ] Sorry, Appa, you'll have to do this on your own.",11
Sokka,"Aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?",11
Aang,"[  Grinning broadly.  ] To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. But when have I ever been?",11
Katara,"He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job.",11
Sokka,[  Dismayed.  ] His job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot isn't it? [  Cut to an overhead wide shot of the two tribes and the others.  ],11
Canyon guide,"Okay, now comes the bad news. [  Cut to a frontal shot of the guide.  ] No food allowed in the canyon, it attracts [  He makes motions with his hands to illustrate the skittery monsters that might lurk in the canyon.  ]  dangerous  predators. [  Both tribes yell out in protest.  ]",11
Gan Jin Leader,No food?! This is ridiculous.,11
Canyon guide,"Oh, you babies can go a day without food? Would you rather be hungry, or dead? [  He raises an earth pillar to tower over the rest. He continues, cupping his hands to his mouth to amplify his voice.  ] Now, we're heading down in ten minutes. All food better be in your gut or in the garbage!",11
Aang,"[  To the people on Appa.  ] Appa's going to take good care of you 'till we get there. [  To Appa.  ] See you on the other side, buddy! Yip yip! [  Appa roars and takes off. The camera fades to show both groups of people climbing down into the canyon. The tour guide earthbends to form a bridge in a gap in the path.  ]",11
Aang,Nice bending!,11
Canyon guide,"The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information. [  Turns to the travelers.  ] Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed. Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by earth spirits who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice.",11
Canyon guide,"He he he, guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought sacrifices.",11
Canyon guide,"Okay, everyone stand clear of the wall. [  He throws the boulder and destroys the bridge he had made earlier.  ]",11
Aang,Why'd you do that?,11
Canyon guide,"These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they? Gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now. [  Yells out, as he is picked up by a huge animal. Aang blows away the dust to reveal a canyon crawler.  ]",11
Sokka,"We gotta help him! [  He throws his boomerang at the crawler, which drops the canyon guide and comes after Sokka instead.  ] Okay, now we gotta help  me  ! [  Katara comes to his aid and does a water whip on the crawler, but she is quickly thrown aside. Aang jumps down and sends a multiple blasts of air at the crawler and drives it away.  ]",11
Aang,[  To the canyon guide.  ] What was that?,11
Canyon guide,[  On the ground.  ] Canyon crawler. [  Groans in pain.  ] And there's sure to be more!,11
Katara,"Your arms, they're broken!",11
Canyon guide,"Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words-",11
Aang,We're trapped in this canyon.,11
Sokka,I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers.,11
Gan Jin leader,It's the Zhangs! They took food down here even after the canyon guide told them not to.,11
Zhang leader,"What? If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day, it's you pampered Gan Jins!",11
Gan Jin leader,I hope you're happy. We're stuck in this canyon with no way out.,11
Zhang leader,"Why don't you thank yourself, food hider?",11
Aang,"Look, sticking together is the only way to-",11
Zhang leader,I'm not walking another step with the likes of them!,11
Gan Jin leader,Now there's something we can agree on.,11
Aang,[  To the canyon guide.  ] Any ideas?,11
Canyon guide,No bendng ... we need to get out of this canyon ... I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!,11
Gan Jin leader,See! We're going to become part of the food chain because of you! [  Points to Zhangs.  ],11
Zhang leader,"Sure, unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do!",11
Gan Jin leader,Gladly.,11
Aang,"[  Angrily.  ] Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen. [  Jumps onto a tall rock.  ] We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines. [  The two leaders nod at each other and start walking. Aang jumps down to Sokka and Katara.  ] Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can find out why they hate each other so much.",11
Sokka,"So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?",11
Zhang leader,What for? Its the dry season.,11
Sokka,Exactly!,11
Zhang leader,"Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket.",11
Sokka,"[  Smiling.  ] Finally, someone gets it!",11
Katara,You really think it'll rain?,11
Gan Jin leader,"No, but you can never be too careful, right?",11
Gan Jin leader,"Would you care for some bread, Katara?",11
Katara,So it was you guys who had food!,11
Gan Jin leader,"Oh come now, you really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food? Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?",11
Katara,"[  Hesitates.  ] Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it. [  Takes the bread and eats it.  ] So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much?",11
Gan Jin leader,"You seem like a smart girl Katara, I bet you would enjoy hearing some history. [  Fades to show a large gate with a finely dressed man running toward it. Voice-over.  ] The patriarch of our tribe, Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual. But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the ground, and stole our sacred orb. [  Camera goes back to the Gan Jin leader's face.  ] Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang.",11
Zhang leader,[  To Sokka.  ] Care for some meat?,11
Sokka,Would I! [  Takes the meat and bites down hungrily.  ],11
Zhang leader,"I know what you must be thinking, we're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here.",11
Sokka,Hm-hmm.,11
Zhang leader,"The Gan Jin think so badly of us, they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in.",11
Sokka,[  Still eating.  ] Hmm.,11
Zhang leader,"Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years. [  Fades to show a poorly-dressed man running through a large gate. Voice-over.  ] Our forefather Wei Jin was leaving the western gate of our village, when he saw a figure in the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison. [  Back to Zhang leader.  ] We Zhangs will never forget that injustice.",11
Sokka,That's just terrible. [  Looks at her piece of meat.  ] You gonna finish that?,11
Aang,"Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts! [  Momo jumps up and snatches a bug out of the air, he eats part of it before offering the rest to Aang.  ] Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts.",11
Canyon guide,"[  Slowly approaching Aang.  ] Lonely isn't it, being impartial?",11
Aang,"I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.",11
Canyon guide,I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated.,11
Canyon guide,"All clear, we're almost to the other side.",11
Aang,"[  Jumps down to Katara and Sokka.  ] Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?",11
Katara,"I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb.",11
Aang,What are you talking about?,11
Sokka,"Yeah Katara, what are you talking about? Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.",11
Katara,Not punished enough if you ask me.,11
Aang,"[  Over Sokka's frustrated growls.  ] Okay, okay I get it! Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall. [  He takes off on his glider and the scene fades to show him landing between the two tribes.  ] Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.",11
Gan Jin leader,Maybe the Zhang can climb the wall with their long disgusting fingernails.,11
Zhang leader,"Oh sorry, I forgot that to the Gan Jin unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!",11
Gan Jin leader,"Why, you dirty thief!",11
Zhang leader,You pompous fool!,11
Aang,"[  Shouting.  ] Guys, focus! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!",11
Zhang leader,Perhaps the Avatar is right.,11
Gan Jin leader,"Yes, perhaps he is. [  Aang grins happily at this.  ]",11
Zhang leader,Harsh words will  never  solve our problems.,11
Gan Jin leader,Action will!,11
Gan Jin leader,To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry!,11
Aang,"You know, I take it back. Harsh words aren't so bad!",11
Aang,"[  Shocked.  ] Is that ... food? Everyone smuggled food down here? Unbelievable! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day? You're all awful! [  He looks in wonder at a custard tart, and his stomach growls.  ] So hungry. Is that an egg custard in that tart? [  He turns to see dozens of canyon crawlers approaching, and they all try to flee.  ]",11
Katara,"Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers.",11
Sokka,[  Taking out his boomerang.  ] We barely survived one!,11
Canyon guide,They're coming back for me! They've had a taste and they're coming back for me!,11
Katara,"Sokka, wait. [  Stops him as he runs forward.  ] I don't care about this stupid feud, I just want us to get out of here alive.",11
Sokka,Me too. I only took their side 'cause they fed me.,11
Aang,"[  Shouting.  ] Everybody, watch me and do what I do! [  He distracts a crawler with a piece of food, leaps on its back, and throws a bag over its snout. The two tribes mimic him, working together.  ] Now follow me! We're riding out of this hole! [  Aang ties a huge bag of food onto a stick and uses it to guide the crawlers up the canyon wall.  ] Everyone, get off!",11
Zhang leader,[  Jumping off a crawler.  ] We made it!,11
Zhang leader,I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that.,11
Gan Jin leader,And I never knew you Zhangs were so reliable in a pinch.,11
Zhang leader,Perhaps we're not so different after all. [  They both smile at each other and Aang sighs in relief.  ],11
Gan Jin leader,Too bad we can't rewrite history. You thieves stole our sacred orb from Jin Wei! [  Draws his sword.  ],11
Zhang leader,[  Draws her sword.  ] You tyrants unjustly imprisoned Wei Jin for twenty long years!,11
Aang,[  Sighs in frustration.  ] Wait a second ... Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!,11
Gan Jin leader,"Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story.",11
Aang,"No, I mean I really  knew  them. I might not look it, but I'm a hundred and twelve years old. I was there one hundred years ago on the day you're talking about. [  Scene fades to show the two men facing each other. Voice-over.  ] There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact, and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for twenty long years but for two short minutes. [  Fades back to Aang.  ] There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was just a game.",11
Zhang leader,You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?,11
Aang,"Nope, just a regular ball.",11
Gan Jin man,What about our tribe's redemption ritual?,11
Aang,"That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell ""redemption""! [  The tribe leaders look at each other skeptically.  ] Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field.",11
Zhang leader,[  To the Gan Jin leader.  ] I suppose it's time we forget the past.,11
Gan Jin leader,[  Bowing.  ] And look to the future.,11
Aang,"Good to see you, boy. Did you miss me? [  Appa licks Aang as the Gan Jin leader approaches.  ]",11
Gan Jin leader,"I cannot thank you enough, Avatar.",11
Aang,"[  Covered in Appa's slobber.  ] Well, you know I try.",11
Gan Jin leader,[  Recoils in disgust.  ] Ugh!,11
Zhang leader,Let us travel to the Earth Kingdom capital as one tribe. [  Both tribes cheer as they start walking.  ],11
Canyon guide,[  Running forward.  ] I'm going too! I'm sick of this place!,11
Sokka,That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.,11
Aang,You could call it luck. Or you could call it lying.,11
Sokka,[  Flabbergasted.  ] What?,11
Aang,I made the whole thing up.,11
Katara,[  Shocked.  ] You did  not  ! [  In devilish admiration.  ] That is  so  wrong.,11
Aang,Now where is that custard tart? I'm starving!,11
Katara,"[  Voice-over.  ] We need you, Aang.",12
Aang,"[  Close-up as he is looking toward Katara; contentedly.  ] I need you, too.",12
Aang,"[  Alarmed.  ] Be careful, guys! [  He looks to his left and right, uneasy.  ] Guys?",12
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] Gyatso?,12
Gyatso,"[  Whispering, his tone sad.  ] Why did you disappear?",12
Aang,[  Frontal shot; his voice soft and sad.  ] I didn't mean to.,12
Gyatso,"[  Voice-over.  ] We need you, Aang.",12
Gyatso and Katara,"[  Echoing voice-over.  ] We need you, Aang. [  Cut to a downward view of an unconscious Aang sinking.  ] We need you. We need you, Aang. We need you.",12
Sokka,[  Drowsily.  ] What's going on? [  He looks around.  ] Did we get captured again?,12
Aang,"[  Shot looking down, sliding right; Aang turns to his friends.  ] It's nothing. I just had a bad dream. [  He curls up, facing away from them.  ] Go back to sleep.",12
Sokka,"[  Curls up, facing away from Aang.  ] Don't have to tell me twice.",12
Katara,"[  Frontal shot of Aang with Katara behind him, looking at him in concern.  ] Are you all right, Aang?",12
Aang,[  Looking lost.  ] I'm okay.,12
Katara,You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately. You want to tell me about it?,12
Aang,[  Briefly closing his eyes.  ] I think I just need some rest.,12
Sokka,"[  Sitting up behind Katara; upbeat.  ] You guys want to hear about my dream? [  Katara glares at him, an expression Sokka returns.  ] That's okay. I didn't want to talk about it anyway.",12
Aang,"Look at those clear skies, buddy! [  Pets Appa's head. Cut to a close shot as he looks up at a flock of birds arranged in a ""V"" flying overhead, their goose-like honking audible.  ] Should be some smooth flying.",12
Katara,"[  Looking from the contents of the bag up to Aang.  ] Well, we better  smoothly  fly [  She steps onto Appa's tail and walks to the saddle.  ] ourselves to a market, 'cause we're out of food.",12
Sokka,"[  Side-shot as he suddenly straightens up, his tone serious.  ] Guys, wait. This was in my dream. [  Momo lands on the pack behind him.  ] We shouldn't go to the market.",12
Katara,"[  Shot cuts beside Sokka, facing out toward Katara and Aang, who turn to look at him; curious.  ] What happened in your dream?",12
Sokka,"[  Frontal shot; his eyes are bugged out in terror and the camera zooms in on him, rolling slightly as the shot takes on a greenish tint and alien music dubs the scene.  ] Food  eats  people! [  The colors return to normal as the shot cuts to Katara's face as she shakes her head. Behind her, Aang goes back to adjusting the reins. Cut to Sokka again as he points at Momo.  ] Also, Momo could talk. [  He glares at Momo while crossing his arms.  ] You said some very unkind things.",12
Iroh,There is a storm coming. A big one.,12
Zuko,"You're out of your mind, Uncle. [  Walking up to Iroh.  ] The weather's perfect. There's not a cloud in sight.",12
Iroh,A storm is approaching from the north. [  He turns to face Zuko.  ] I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.,12
Zuko,"[  Taking a few steps in Iroh's direction, pointing briefly northward.  ] We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same.",12
Iroh,"[  Cut to his face; stern.  ] Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.",12
Zuko,[  Cut to his face as he advances on his uncle angrily.  ] The safety of the crew doesn't matter!,12
Zuko,Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.,12
Iroh,"[  Reassuringly, a twinge of uncertainty in his voice, almost as if he does not fully believe what he is saying.  ] He doesn't mean that. He's just all worked up.",12
Merchant woman,"[  Scowling.  ] Ahhh, it's good. It's perfect, I'm telling you!",12
Katara,"[  Shaking the watermelon, which emits an audible sloshing sound.  ] I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.",12
Merchant woman,"[  As the shot zooms out, the merchant moves around the stand where Katara stands. Sokka and Aang, staff in hand, stand beside them; the former is filling a basket with fruit.  ] Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?",12
Aang,"[  Taking a step toward Katara.  ] I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe.",12
Katara,"[  As the shot cuts to a frontal view of her, she puts the melon back on the stand.  ] I just realized we're out of money anyway.",12
Shopkeeper,"[  Annoyed, grabbing a basket full of fruits from Sokka.  ] Awww!",12
Sokka,Out of food and out of money. Now what are we supposed to do?,12
Katara,"You could get a job, smart guy.",12
Fisherman's wife,"We shouldn't go out there! Please, the fish can wait. There's going to be a terrible storm. [  Camera cuts to show Aang, who appears alarmed by the prediction.  ]",12
Fisherman,"You're crazy. It's a nice day: [  Gesturing to the sky with both arms.  ] No clouds, no winds, no nothing. So quit your nagging, woman.",12
Aang,[  Nervously suggesting to Katara and Sokka.  ] Maybe we should find some shelter?,12
Sokka,[  Indicating the fair weather.  ] Are you kidding? Shelter from  what  ?,12
Fisherman's wife,My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.,12
Fisherman,"Well, it's your joints against my brain.",12
Fisherman's wife,"Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, 'cause I ain't comin'.",12
Fisherman,"Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him  double  what you get! [  Cut to a side shot of the couple, showing Sokka running up to them.  ] How do you like that?",12
Sokka,"[  Interrupting, raising his hand.  ] I'll go.",12
Fisherman,"You're hired! [  Shoots a triumphant look at his wife, who scowls back.  ]",12
Sokka,"[  After a short pause, to Katara and Aang.  ] What? You said get a job ... and he's  paying double  .",12
Fisherman,"[  Rounding on Sokka, his expression wild.  ] Double? Who told you that nonsense?",12
Lieutenant Jee,Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all.,12
Iroh,[  Pleasantly.  ] Lucky guess.,12
Zuko,"[  Whirling around and walking toward Jee; angry.  ] Lieutenant! You'd better learn some respect [  Jabs two fingers into Jee's chest.  ] – or I will teach it to you. [  Begins to walk away from Jee, who follows Zuko with his eyes, continuing his taunting after a short pause.  ]",12
Jee,"What do  you  know about  respect  ? [  Behind Jee, Iroh's expression turns to panic and he makes a cutting motion at his throat with his hand, trying to signal Lieutenant Jee to stop. Cut to Zuko's back as he stops walking before switching to his face as he listens to Jee's words.  ] The way you talk to everyone around here, from your hard-working crew to your esteemed uncle, shows you know  nothing  about respect! [  Cut to a close-up of Iroh's face as he gasps slightly, reaching out a hand in desperation before moving it to his forehead in resignation, believing Jee has gone too far. Cut back to Zuko's face, contorted with rage.  ] You don't care about anyone but yourself! Then again, what should I expect from a  spoiled prince  ?",12
Iroh,"Easy now. [  Both Zuko and Jee wrist-block the other's arm; smoke rises from a furious Zuko's hand. Interrupting the staredown, Iroh extends an arm and pulls theirs apart; the smoke fades.  ] Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better.",12
Zuko,I don't need your help keeping order on my ship.,12
Aang,"Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky.",12
Sokka,I said I was going to do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather.,12
Fisherman's wife,The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!,12
Fisherman,"Boy with tattoos? [  The fisherman turns around to look at Aang.  ] Airbender tattoos. Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle. You're the Avatar, ain't ya?",12
Katara,That's right. [  Katara and Aang smile.  ],12
Fisherman,"Well, don't be so smiley about it. [  Katara and Aang frown now.  ] The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years! You turned your back on the world!",12
Katara,Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone.,12
Fisherman,"Oh, he wouldn't, huh? Then I guess I must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering. [  Aang's eyes widen.  ]",12
Katara,"Aang is the bravest person I know. He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him. [  Behind Katara's back, Aang slowly begins to backpedal away from her.  ] It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? [  Katara turns around to see Aang backing away.  ] Aang, what's wrong?",12
Fisherman,That's right! Keep flying!,12
Katara,"You're a horrible old man! [  She gets on Appa, who is floating beside the dock.  ] Appa, yip yip!",12
Sokka,Hey! They left without saying good-bye!,12
Fisherman,"Your friends ain't too polite, are they?",12
Sokka,"I know! This one time, I was ...",12
Fisherman,"[  Hands Sokka a crate, interrupting him impolitely.  ] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Get below deck!",12
Aang,[  Quietly.  ] I'm sorry for running away.,12
Katara,It's okay. That fisherman was  way  out of line.,12
Aang,"Actually, he wasn't.",12
Katara,[  Surprised.  ] What do you mean?,12
Aang,[  Speaks in a sad voice.  ] I don't want to talk about it.,12
Katara,"It has to do with your dream, doesn't it? [  Puts her hand on his shoulder.  ] Talk to me.",12
Aang,"Well, it's kind of a long story.",12
Katara,I'm going to try to get a little fire going.,12
Aang,I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar. I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter.,12
Aang,"First you got to form the ball, then you got to get on quick.",12
Air Nomad boy #1,"Okay, here goes.",12
Aang,You kind of have to balance on it like it's a top.,12
Air Nomad boy #1,"Man, that's hard.",12
Air Nomad boy #2,"Where'd you learn that trick, Aang?",12
Aang,I made it up.,12
Air Nomad boy #2,Wow!,12
Gyatso,"Aang, come with us. We need to speak with you.",12
Aang,How do you know it's me?,12
Tashi,We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these?,12
Aang,Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little! [  He picks up the propeller toy.  ],12
Tashi,"You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives.",12
Aang,I just chose them because they seemed fun.,12
Tashi,You chose them because they were familiar.,12
Gyatso,"Normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned sixteen, but there are troubling signs. Storm clouds are gathering.",12
Pasang,"I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar.",12
Gyatso,"We need you, Aang.",12
Jee,"I'm sick of taking his orders! I'm tired of chasing his Avatar! I mean, who does Zuko think he is?",12
Iroh,Do you really want to know?,12
Jee,General Iroh. We were just- [  Iroh cuts him off.  ],12
Iroh,It's okay. May I join you?,12
Jee,"Of course, sir.",12
Iroh,[  Massages his beard.  ] Try to understand. My nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much.,12
Young Zuko,Let me in!,12
Iroh,"[  Places his hands on Zuko's shoulders.  ] Prince Zuko, what's wrong?",12
Young Zuko,I want to go into the war chamber [  Points to the guard.  ] but the guard won't let me pass!,12
Iroh,"[  Leads Zuko away with his left hand still on his shoulder.  ] You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.",12
Young Zuko,"If I'm going to rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?",12
Iroh,"Very well. But you must promise not to speak. [  Another elder soldier walks by them into the war chamber.  ] These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?",12
Young Zuko,"[  Bows to Iroh.  ] Thank you, Uncle.",12
Bujing,The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here. [  Bujing shows the place on the map.  ] A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors. So I am recommending the forty-first division.,12
Elder soldier,But the forty-first is entirely new recruits. How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?,12
Bujing,I don't  . They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear. What better to use as bait than fresh meat?,12
Young Zuko,[  Zuko is shown standing up.  ] You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?,12
Iroh,"Zuko was right, you see, [  Massages his beard again.  ] but it was not his place to speak out. And there were dire consequences. [  Slightly bows his head.  ]",12
Katara,So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?,12
Aang,"Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew was that after I found out, everything began changing.",12
Aang,"Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!",12
Air Nomad boy #2,Not only that! We made up a game you can play with the air scooters!,12
Aang,Great! [  Aang is shown making his own. But everyone else makes theirs vanish.  ] What's going on?,12
Air Nomad boy #1,"Now that you're the Avatar, it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on.",12
Aang,"But I'm still the same! Nothing's changed! So, what? I can't play?",12
Air Nomad boy #1,That's the only fair way.,12
Aang,"Oh, okay.",12
Air Nomad boy #2,"Sorry, Aang.",12
Air Nomad boy #1,"Okay. Now, who wants Jinju on their team?",12
Gyatso,"Very interesting move, young one.",12
Aang,What do you mean?,12
Aang,Hey!,12
Tashi,You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training!,12
Gyatso,Aang has already trained enough for today.,12
Tashi,Time is short. [  To Aang.  ] Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques.,12
Gyatso,"No. As long as I'm his guardian, I will decide when he trains ... and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho.",12
Tashi,Hmph.,12
Iroh,"After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him. [  Flashback quickly ends.  ] He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this.",12
Jee,Agni Kai. A fire duel.,12
Iroh,"That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood. [  Flashback shows an overview of the chamber; the camera cuts to show Zuko preparing for the Agni Kai.  ] When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general. [  Flashback shows the tippet that was on Zuko's shoulders fall down to the ground.  ] Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. [  Frontal shot of a surprised Zuko; as the camera zooms in on him, his expression changes to one of fear.  ] Zuko would have to duel his own father.",12
Aang,"Then, just when I was feeling better, something worse happened.",12
Gyatso,Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.,12
Tashi,You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.,12
Pasang,"Gyatso, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment.",12
Gyatso,All I want is what is best for him.,12
Pasang,But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated! The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.,12
Katara,"That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say.",12
Aang,[  Stands up.  ] How could they do that to me? They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved! [  He activates the Avatar State.  ],12
Katara,Whoa! Hot cinders!,12
Aang,I'm sorry I got so mad.,12
Katara,You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.,12
Aang,"Well, that's not exactly what happened. [  Flashback starts again, showing Aang looking out the window of his bedroom.  ] I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do.",12
Gyatso,"Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang? [  Gyatso is shown opening the door more, spotting the scroll, and opening it up. He gasps, and sees a storm coming outside the window.  ]",12
Aang,"[  Still in present, but flashback playing still.  ] I never saw Gyatso again. [  Flashback shows Aang and Appa through the storm, and how Aang got into the iceberg.  ] Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.",12
Katara,You ran away.,12
Aang,And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.,12
Katara,You don't know what would have-.,12
Aang,The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.,12
Katara,Aang ...,12
Aang,The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world!,12
Katara,"You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.",12
Aang,You don't know that.,12
Katara,I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.,12
Iroh,"When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.",12
Young Zuko,"[  Cut to a side-view of Zuko.  ] Please, Father. I only had the Fire Nation's best interest at heart. I'm sorry I spoke out of turn! [  Slightly lowers his head.  ]",12
Ozai,You will fight for your honor.,12
Young Zuko,"[  Frontal shot; kneels on his knees and forearms, while looking at the floor.  ] I meant you no disrespect. [  Gazes up at his father, tears shimmering in his eyes as his voice starts to waver.  ] I am your loyal son.",12
Ozai,"[  Far off frontal shot of Zuko as Ozai's shadow and eventually his head come into view.  ] Rise and  fight  , Prince Zuko!",12
Young Zuko,I  won't  fight you.,12
Ozai,"You  will  learn respect, [  Zuko pushes himself up on his knees and hands. Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko as he starts to shake.  ] and  suffering  will be your [  Zuko looks up at Ozai, tears streaming down his face.  ] teacher.",12
Iroh,[  Voice-over; Iroh closes his eyes and averts his head to the left.  ] I looked away.,12
Jee,I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident.,12
Iroh,"It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.",12
Jee,So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.,12
Iroh,Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.,12
Fisherman's wife,"Help! Oh, please help!",12
Katara,[  Grabs lady and brings her near the fire.  ] It's okay. You're safe.,12
Fisherman's wife,But my husband isn't.,12
Katara,What do you mean? Where's Sokka?,12
Fisherman's wife,They haven't returned! They should have been back by now! And this storm is becoming a typhoon! They're caught out at sea!,12
Aang,I'm going to find him!,12
Katara,I'm going with you!,12
Fisherman's wife,I'm staying here.,12
Aang,We'll be back soon. I promise.,12
Zuko,Where were we hit?,12
Jee,I don't know!,12
Iroh,Look!,12
Zuko,The helmsman!,12
Katara,Where are they?,12
Aang,"Come on, Appa! The boat! There!",12
Zuko,The Avatar!,12
Jee,"What do you want to do, sir?",12
Zuko,Let him go. We need to get this ship to safety.,12
Iroh,Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.,12
Sokka,I'm too young to die!,12
Fisherman,"I'm not, but I still don't wanna!",12
Aang,Hang onto the rope.,12
Zuko,"Uncle, I'm sorry.",12
Iroh,Your apology is accepted.,12
Fisherman's wife,"Oh, you're alive! You owe this boy an apology!",12
Aang,He doesn't have to apologize.,12
Fisherman,"What if, instead of an apology, I give him a free fish and we call it even?",12
Aang,"Actually, I don't eat meat.",12
Fisherman,Fish ain't meat!,12
Sokka,"Seriously, you're still going to pay me, right?",12
Aang,"Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past.",12
Katara,Really?,12
Aang,I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it.,12
Katara,I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.,12
Fisherman,"And if you weren't here now, well, I guess I wouldn't be either. Thank you for saving my life, Avatar.",12
Sokka,Do you hear that? It stopped raining.,12
Aang,Appa!,12
Shinu,"[  In response to Zhao; somewhat angrily.  ] Absolutely not! The Yuyan Archers stay here. Your request is  denied  , Commander Zhao.",13
Zhao,"Colonel Shinu, please reconsider ... Their precision is legendary. The Yuyan can pin a fly to a tree from one hundred yards away ... without killing it. [  Annoyed.  ] You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards.",13
Shinu,"I can do whatever I want with their talents. They're  my  archers, and what I say goes.",13
Zhao,But my search for the Avatar is-,13
Shinu,"[  Cutting Zhao off mid-sentence while getting close to him and scoffing angrily.  ] Is nothing but a vanity project! We're fighting a  real  war here, and I need every man I've got, Commander.",13
Zhao,But-!,13
Shinu,[  Furiously.  ] That's final! I don't wanna hear another word about it!,13
Zhao,[  Intrigued.  ] News from Fire Lord Ozai?,13
Zhao,[  Pleased.  ] It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request ... is now an order.,13
Katara,[  Pressing a wet rag onto Sokka's forehead.  ] This should bring your fever down.,13
Sokka,You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor.,13
Katara,That's nice. I'll tell him.,13
Sokka,[  Laughs.  ] Classic Appa.,13
Aang,How's Sokka doing?,13
Katara,Not so good. Being out in that storm really did a number on him.,13
Aang,"I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea, but I found a map. [  Places the map on the floor.  ] There's an herbalist institute on top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.",13
Katara,"Aang, he's in no condition for travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow. [  Starts coughing.  ]",13
Aang,"Not you, too!",13
Katara,"Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fi- [  She coughs again, this time with greater force, and lightly groans after.  ]",13
Aang,[  Shielding his face.  ] That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him! He thinks he's an earthbender!,13
Sokka,"[  Delirious.  ] Take that, you rock! [  He flails his arms as if he is hitting something.  ]",13
Aang,"A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too. I'm going to go find some medicine. [  He grabs his glider and begins to head out just as a flash of lightning strikes.  ] Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. [  To Appa and Momo.  ] Keep an eye on them, guys. [  Appa groans while Momo chitters.  ]",13
Sokka,"Ha, ha! You guys are killing me!",13
Jee,"[  Using a map.  ] We haven't been able to pick up the Avatar's trail since the storm, but if we continue heading northeast ... [  A larger Fire Nation ship pulls up next to theirs.  ]",13
Zuko,What do they want?,13
Iroh,"Perhaps, a sporting game of Pai Sho!",13
Messenger,[  To Zuko.  ] The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance. All information regarding the Avatar [  Rolls up poster and places it behind his back.  ]  must  be reported directly to Admiral Zhao.,13
Iroh,"Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him! [  As Iroh makes a move in his Pai Sho game, another player slaps his hand against his own forehead as if he lost.  ]",13
Zuko,[  Looking down.  ] I've got nothing to report to Zhao. [  Glares back at the messenger.  ] Now get off my ship and let us pass.,13
Messenger,Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.,13
Zuko,[  Snaps angrily at the messenger.  ]  Off my ship!  [  The messenger and the soldiers leave immediately.  ],13
Iroh,[  Iroh wins his game.  ] Excellent! I take the pot! [  A crew member punches himself.  ] But you're all improving! I'm certain you will win if we play again.,13
Scout #1,[  Reading Aang's wanted poster out loud.  ] Says here that the Avatar can create tornadoes and run faster than the wind. Pretty amazing!,13
Scout #2,"Ah, that's just a bunch of Fire Lord propaganda. There's no way that's true!",13
Sokka,"[  Weakly.  ] Katara, please, water.",13
Katara,"[  Also weak.  ] Listen carefully, Momo. [  Holds up a water skin.  ] I need you to take this to the river, and fill it with water. [  She is shown through Momo's eyes, speaking gibberish.  ] Got it? [  Momo takes the skin and flies off.  ]",13
Aang,"[  Speaking fast.  ] Hello, I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I  need  some medicine for my friends, they have fevers and they were coughing- [  Gets cut off by the herbalist.  ]",13
Herbalist,"Settle down, young man. Your friends are going to be fine. I've been up here for over forty years, you know. Used to be others, but they all left years ago. [  She pets Miyuki who begins to purr.  ] Now it's just me and Miyuki.",13
Aang,That's nice.,13
Herbalist,"Wounded Earth Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave boys, and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they when they arrive.",13
Aang,That's nice. Are you almost done?,13
Herbalist,"Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient. [  Walking among the shrubbery, looking around and muttering to herself.  ] Oh, sandalwood ... oh, er, uh, that won't do, banana leaf? Ah, nope, uh, ginger root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant?",13
Iroh,Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.,13
Zuko,I don't care what they do.,13
Iroh,Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.,13
Zuko,"[  Turning back, desperation and fear on his face.  ] How, Uncle? With Zhao's resources, it's just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar. [  Turns back out to sea and whispers.  ] My honor, my throne, my country, I'm about to lose them all.",13
Herbalist,"Oh, here's what I was looking for! Plum blossom. [  She plucks a flower from the tree.  ]",13
Aang,"[  He lifts up his head off the table.  ] Finally! [  Close-up of the mixing bowl as the herbalist drops the flower into the mixture, and Aang grabs for the bowl.  ] Thanks for all your help!",13
Herbalist,Hands off!,13
Aang,Ow!,13
Herbalist,"[  Close-up, holding her spoon at the ready for a new attack.  ] What do you think you're doing?",13
Aang,"[  Rubs his hand, flinching.  ] Taking the cure to my friends.",13
Herbalist,[  Lowers her spoon; laughs.  ] This isn't a cure! It's Miyuki's dinner. Plum blossom is her favorite.,13
Aang,What about my friends?,13
Herbalist,"Well, all they need are some frozen wood frogs. There's plenty of them down in the valley swamp.",13
Aang,[  Confused.  ] What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?,13
Herbalist,"Why, suck on them, of course!",13
Aang,[  Shocked and disgusted; his eye twitches.  ] Suck on them?,13
Herbalist,"The frog skin excretes a substance that'll cure your friends, but make sure you get plenty. Once those little critters thaw out, they're useless!",13
Aang,"[  Pause.  ] You're insane, aren't you?",13
Herbalist,"[  Crazily.  ] That's right! Well, don't stand there all day! Go! [  Throws green sludge from her spoon onto Aang's eyes. He starts blinking.  ]",13
Aang,"Uh ... I think you dropped this ... [  Screams as he sees the Yuyan Archers taking aim at him. Panicking, he frees himself from the arrow that had pinned his foot to the ground and runs. He falls off a cliff into a swamp and finds the frozen frogs.  ] A frog!",13
Zhao,"So this is the great Avatar. Master of all the elements. I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years, but your little game of hide and seek is over.",13
Aang,[  Angry.  ] I've never hidden from you! Untie me and I'll fight you right now!,13
Zhao,"Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left? Do you miss your people? [  Aang looks down sadly.  ] Don't worry, you won't be killed like they were. [  Aang looks angry again.  ] See, if you die you will just be reborn and the Fire Nation would have to start searching all over again. So I'll keep you alive, but just barely. [  Aang takes a deep breath and blows at gale force at Zhao, who falls over.  ] Blow all the wind you want, but your situation is futile. There is no escaping this fortress, and no one is coming to rescue you.",13
Sokka,[  Weakly.  ] Water ...,13
Katara,[  Weakly.  ] Momo should be back any minute.,13
Katara,"[  Weakly; in disgust.  ] Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter! [  Momo's ear go straight up. He jumps off her and scampers.  ] Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?",13
Guard,All clear.,13
Guard,All clear. Go on in.,13
Zhao,"We are the sons and daughters of fire, the superior element! Until today only one thing stood our path to victory, the Avatar. I am here to tell you that he is now my prisoner! [  The crowd cheers.  ] This is the year Sozin's Comet returns to grant us its power! [  The crowd cheers.  ] This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls of Ba Sing Se and burns the city to the ground!",13
Aang,"[  To the frogs.  ] What? No! Don't leave, frogs! My friends are sick and they need you! Please go back to being frozen!",13
Aang,"Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me? [  The Blue Spirit opens the door and motions for him to follow.  ] I'll take that as a ""yes.""",13
Aang,"My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out! [  The Blue Spirit comes back, picks him up by the collar and carries him out.  ] Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!",13
Katara,"[  With a weak, sickly voice.  ] How many times do I have to tell you, Momo? We need water, wa-ter. Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry.",13
Sokka,"[  Delirious.  ] Who's this ""Aang"" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness? [  Katara gets an annoyed look on her face.  ]",13
Zhao,"I want a full transcription of my speech sent to the Fire Lord, along with glowing testimonials from all of the ranking officers present, and –",13
Scribe,"Sir, should I hold off sending that speech to the Fire Lord?",13
Soldier,"There, on the wall!",13
Zhao,"[  Shouting.  ] The Avatar has escaped! Close all the gates immediately! [  Cut to the escapees running, Aang passes the Blue Spirit.  ]",13
Aang,Stay close to me!,13
Aang,Take this. Jump on my back!,13
Aang,Give me the next one!,13
Zhao,Hold your fire! The Avatar must be captured alive!,13
Zhao,[  Through gritted teeth.  ] Open the gate.,13
Shinu,"Admiral, what are you doing?",13
Zhao,"Let them out, now!",13
Shinu,How could you let them go?,13
Zhao,A situation like this requires ... precision.,13
Zhao,Do you have a clear shot?,13
Zhao,Knock out the thief. I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord along with the Avatar.,13
Zhao,Quick! Recover the Avatar!,13
Aang,"[  To Zuko.  ] You know what the worst part of being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you. If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?",13
Iroh,"Where have you been, Prince Zuko? You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.",13
Zuko,I'm going to bed. No disturbances.,13
Aang,Suck on these. They'll make you feel better.,13
Sokka,"[  With his mouth full; still spouting out nonsense.  ] Aang, how was your trip? Did you make any new friends?",13
Aang,"No, I don't think I did.",13
Sokka,Mmmm! This is tasty! Mmm!,13
Katara,[  Excitedly.  ] Look!,14
Sokka,He is taunting us! [  Camera zooms out to the lake and the group's camp site.  ] You are so going to be dinner!,14
Sokka,"[  Observes the fishing pole.  ] Hey, where's the fishing line?",14
Aang,"[  Sheepishly.  ] Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka. [  He holds up an intricately woven necklace decorated with a red flower.  ]",14
Sokka,"[  Walks over and examines the necklace.  ] Aw, it's all tangled!",14
Aang,"[  Rises to his feet.  ] Not tangled. Woven! I made you a necklace, Katara. I thought since you lost your other one ...",14
Katara,"[  Smiling and approaching him.  ] Thanks, Aang. [  Takes the necklace.  ] I love it.",14
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Great, Aang. Maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelry-making business.",14
Aang,I don't see why I can't do both.,14
Sokka,Stop taunting me!,14
Katara,"[  Off-camera.  ] So, how do I look?",14
Aang,"[  Nervously.  ] You mean, all of you or just your neck? [  Puts his right hand behind his head in embarrassment.  ] I mean, because they both look great!",14
Sokka,"[  Emerges from the water, holding the se tu.  ] Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love! [  Makes kissing noises before the se tu breaks free from his grasp, slapping Sokka in the face with its tail and disappearing under the water.  ]",14
Aang,"[  Embarrassed.  ] I ... well, uh ...",14
Katara,"[  Annoyed.  ] Stop teasing him, Sokka. Aang's just a good friend. [  Pats the side of his head.  ] A sweet, little guy! Just like Momo. [  Pets Momo, who lands on Aang's shoulder.  ]",14
Aang,[  Dismayed.  ] Thanks.,14
Aang,[  Urgently.  ] Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!,14
Calm man,"Well, hello there! [  Dodges another swift swing of the bear's claws.  ] Nice day, isn't it?",14
Aang,Make noise! He'll run off!,14
Sokka,"No, play dead! He'll lose interest!",14
Calm man,"[  Happily.  ] Whoa, close one! [  Laughs bemusedly.  ]",14
Katara,"[  Cups a hand to her mouth and makes gestures with her other hand.  ] Run downhill, then climb a tree!",14
Sokka,"No, punch him in the bill! [  Swings a fist upward.  ]",14
Aang,And then run in zig-zags!,14
Calm man,"No need, it's going to be fine!",14
Aang,[  Holding his hands out in front of him and assuming a fighting stance.  ] Whoa there!,14
Sokka,"[  Joyfully picks up the egg.  ] Mmm, lunch! [  He sniffs it.  ] Lucky for you, we came along.",14
Calm man,"Thanks, but everything was already under control. Not to worry. Aunt Wu predicted I'd have a safe journey. [  Folds hands together and bows slightly.  ]",14
Aang,Aunt who?,14
Calm man,"No, Aunt  Wu  . She's the fortuneteller from my village. Awful nice knowing your future.",14
Katara,"[  Looks off to the side as she ponders this.  ] Wow, it must be. [  Faces the man with a bright expression on her face.  ] That explains why you were so calm!",14
Sokka,But the fortuneteller was wrong! You didn't have a safe journey; you were almost killed!,14
Calm man,"[  Cheerfully.  ] But I wasn't! All right, have a good one! [  He bids them a farewell and begins to walk away only to turn back again.  ] Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met any travelers to give them this.",14
Katara,[  Excitedly.  ] Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun.,14
Sokka,"Oh, come on. Fortune telling is nonsense!",14
Aang,What do you know? An umbrella!,14
Katara,That proves it! [  She ducks under the umbrella.  ],14
Sokka,"[  Holding egg above his head to shield himself from the rain.  ] No, it doesn't! You can't  really  tell the future!",14
Katara,[  Smugly.  ] I guess you're not  really  getting wet then.,14
Sokka,[  Crossly.  ] Of course she predicted it was going to rain. The sky's been gray all day!,14
Katara,"Just admit you might be wrong, and you can come under the umbrella.",14
Sokka,"Look, I'm going to predict the future now. [  Stops walking and hops from foot to foot in an exaggerated way.  ] It's going to keep drizzling. [  The rain continues to fall.  ] See?",14
Aang,"Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.",14
Sokka,[  Disgusted.  ] Agh!,14
Strange Man,Aunt Wu is expecting you.,14
Katara,[  Excitedly.  ] Really?,14
Meng,My name is Meng and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.,14
Meng,"[  Pleased.  ] Well, hello there.",14
Aang,[  Rubs nose in disinterest.  ] Hello.,14
Meng,[  Aang and Katara seat themselves on the pillows.  ] Can I get you some tea or some of Aunt Wu's special bean curd puffs?,14
Sokka,[  Brightening.  ] I'll try a curd puff.,14
Meng,[  Holds up index finger in gesture.  ] Just a second. [  To Aang.  ] So what's your name?,14
Aang,[  Flatly.  ] Aang.,14
Meng,"[  Delighted.  ] That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you?",14
Aang,[  Awkwardly.  ] I guess.,14
Sokka,[  Waves hand in dismissal and jokes.  ] Don't be modest! [  Spreads arms outward in emphasis.  ] They're huge!,14
Meng,"[  Begins walking away.  ] Well, Aang, it was very nice to meet you. [  Smiles slyly.  ]  Very  nice. [  Turns and leaves.  ]",14
Aang,Likewise.,14
Sokka,I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.,14
Katara,"Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?",14
Sokka,[  Nonchalantly.  ] It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.,14
Woman,"Oh, Meng! Aunt Wu says I'm going to meet my true love. He's going to give me a rare panda lily.",14
Meng,"That's so romantic! [  Dreamily, while casting Aang a flirtatious look.  ] I wonder if my true love will give  me  a rare flower.",14
Aang,[  Breezily.  ] Good luck with that!,14
Woman,[  Trying to contain her laughter.  ] Is that the big-eared guy who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?,14
Meng,[  Nervously.  ] Enjoy your snack! [  Leaves in a hurry.  ],14
Wu,"Welcome, young travelers. Now, who's next? Don't be shy.",14
Katara,[  Rising in anticipation.  ] I guess that's me.,14
Sokka,"[  Delighted; with his mouth full.  ] Mm, not bad, not bad! [  Holding out bowl to Aang.  ] Mhm?",14
Aang,"[  Refusing the bowl.  ] I'm good on puffs. [  Sokka shrugs and continues eating the puffs; trying to act casual.  ] So, what do you think they're talking about back there?",14
Sokka,"[  Causally, holding up puff.  ] Boring stuff I'm sure. Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have.",14
Aang,"[  Trying to act cool.  ] Yeah, dumb stuff like that ... [  Tenses a bit and bites his fingers nervously.  ] Well, I've got to find a bathroom.",14
Wu,Your palms are so smooth. Do you use moisturizer?,14
Katara,"Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I can get you some if you want. [  Aang sticks out his tongue; slight pause.  ] So, do you see anything interesting in my love line? [  Aang immediately perks up upon hearing this.  ]",14
Wu,[  Somewhat dramatically.  ] I feel a great romance for you. The man you are going to marry.,14
Katara,[  Excitedly.  ] Tell me more!,14
Wu,I can see that he's a very powerful bender.,14
Sokka,Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.,14
Aang,Yeah ... when I was in there ...,14
Sokka,"[  Disgusted, looking away and holding up a hand to signal Aang to stop.  ] I don't even want to know!",14
Wu,[  Entering the room with Katara.  ] Who's next?,14
Sokka,"[  Rising.  ] Okay, let's get this over with.",14
Wu,"[  Dryly.  ] Your future is full of struggle and anguish. Most of it, self-inflicted.",14
Sokka,[  Holding up his hands in protest.  ] But you didn't read my palms or anything!,14
Wu,"I don't need to. It's written all over your face. [  Sokka resumes picking his teeth in disgust; to Aang.  ] You there, come with me.",14
Wu,"This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The bones never lie. [  Urging Aang to pick a bone.  ] Go on, pick one. [  Aang takes one bone and they sit down.  ] Now throw it on the fire. [  Aang tosses the bone into the fire.  ] The heat makes cracks in the bone and I read the bone cracks to tell your destiny.",14
Aang,"Wow, that's a big crack.",14
Wu,[  Surprised.  ] I've never seen this before!,14
Wu,"[  Her and Aang shielding their faces in surprise.  ] Oh my! [  Cuts to shot of the bone lying in the fire and back to Aunt Wu who is fascinated.  ] Your destiny! This is incredible. You will be involved in a great battle, an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil. A battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!",14
Aang,"[  Casually.  ] Yeah, yeah, I knew that already. But did it say anything about a girl?",14
Wu,[  Surprised.  ] A girl? You want to know about  love  ?,14
Aang,[  Excited.  ] Yes!,14
Wu,"I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything.",14
Wu,"[  Trying to cheer him up.  ] Well, look! [  Holding her hand against her face in mock forgetfulness.  ] I must've missed something. [  Cuts to a bone piece lying on the floor; Wu picks it up.  ] Right here. [  Holds bone up to examine it.  ] It says ""trust your heart and you will be with the one you love.""",14
Aang,"Really? [  Rises to his feet joyfully.  ] Thank you, Aunt Wu!",14
Sokka,"Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax.",14
Katara,You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.,14
Sokka,[  Voice rising in anger.  ] That woman is crazy! My life will calm and happy and joyful!,14
Sokka,That doesn't prove  anything  !,14
Katara,"[  Satisfied.  ] Well, I liked my predictions. [  Clasps her hands together anxiously.  ] Certain things are going to turn out very well.",14
Aang,"[  Slyly, crossing his arms and leaning in toward her.  ] They sure are ...",14
Katara,Why? What did she tell you?,14
Aang,[  Ambiguously.  ] Some stuff. You'll find out.,14
Katara,[  Looking at the sky.  ] What's with the sky?,14
Calm man,[  Also viewing the sky.  ] We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds to predict the fate of the whole village.,14
Aang,[  Pointing upward.  ] That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny.,14
Calm man,[  Slightly worried.  ] You better hope that's not a bunny! The fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction.,14
Sokka,[  Disgusted.  ] Do you even hear yourself?,14
Village Woman,[  Gesturing to the mountain in the background.  ] The cloud reading will tell us if Mt. Makapu will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt.,14
Calm man,"We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain to check the volcano ourselves. [  Smiles.  ] But every since Aunt Wu moved to the village twenty years ago, we have a tradition of  not  doing that.",14
Sokka,"I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition!",14
Katara,[  Laying a hand on Sokka's shoulder.  ] Shhh! She's coming!,14
Meng,"[  Trying to impress him.  ] Hey, Aang. [  Pointing upward.  ] Don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?",14
Aang,"[  Awkwardly.  ] Huh? Sure, I guess. [  He pushes Meng away as the camera pans to the right; to Katara.  ] Hey, Katara, don't you think that cloud look like a flower?",14
Katara,[  Annoyed.  ] Shhh!,14
Wu,[  Thoughtfully.  ] Bending arrow cloud ... good crops this year. Nice big harvest.,14
Farmer,[  Hugs elderly woman happily.  ] Darn good news!,14
Wu,"Wavy, moon-shaped cloud ... let's see. [  Smiling.  ] Gonna be a great year for twins!",14
Poi and Ping,[  High-five each other joyfully.  ] Yes!,14
Wu,[  Thoughtfully.  ] And a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob coming off the end of it ... [  Spreads arms outward again.  ] The village will  not  be destroyed by the volcano this year!,14
Aang,"[  Slightly nervous.  ] Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal.",14
Aang,[  Crushed.  ] Never mind.,14
Katara,"Hi, Aunt Wu! Sorry to bother you.",14
Wu,Any time.,14
Katara,"About this man I'm supposed to marry ... [  Looks down awkwardly and blushes.  ] Is he going to be handsome? [  Clasps her hands together hopefully.  ] Oh, I hope he's tall!",14
Wu,Ah ... You want another reading?,14
Katara,"Yes, please!",14
Sokka,"I can't believe all these saps! [  Cuts to side-view of Sokka walking forward, Aang following close behind.  ] Someone really needs to scream some sense into them.",14
Aang,"They seem happy, Sokka.",14
Sokka,"Not for long. I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense. [  Pulls over a man standing nearby.  ] Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she? [  Cuts to shot of the man's red shoes.  ]",14
Man,Yeah. She said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love.,14
Sokka,Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?,14
Man,[  Smiles sheepishly.  ] Everyday.,14
Sokka,[  Background becomes a spiral of swirling orange and yellow flames; angry.  ] Then of course it's gonna come true!,14
Man,[  Delighted.  ] Really? You think so? [  Begins walking away.  ] I'm so excited!,14
Wu,"And then you will have your third great-grandchild before quietly passing away in your sleep. [  Cuts to shot of Aunt Wu, who does not seem particularly happy.  ] Is that enough information for you?",14
Katara,"[  Lifts her palm in wonder.  ] Wow, thanks, Aunt Wu. [  She rises and prepares to leave, but suddenly turns back.  ] Oh wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow?",14
Wu,You want me to do a reading for  that  ?,14
Sokka,[  Crazed.  ] I don't care what Aunt Wu told you! You have to take a bath sometime!,14
Aang,"So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?",14
Sokka,[  Pleased.  ]  Some  stuff? [  Places an arm around Aang's shoulders.  ] You've come to the right place. What can I do you for?,14
Aang,"Well, there's this girl.",14
Sokka,[  Thinking of Meng rather than Katara.  ] I think I know who you mean.,14
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] You do? And you're okay with it?,14
Sokka,"Of course I am. And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too.",14
Aang,[  Growing anxious; Meng tries to catch Aang's attention in the background.  ] She does?,14
Sokka,"Oh yeah, she's crazy about you. All you have to do now is not mess it up.",14
Aang,"Well, how do I do that?",14
Sokka,The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.,14
Aang,You can be too nice?,14
Sokka,"Yep. If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other.",14
Aang,"Well, okay ...",14
Meng,"Hey, Aang, I was wondering ...",14
Aang,See you later ... [  Walks away casually and waves hand breezily.  ],14
Sokka,"[  Impressed.  ] Wow, that kid is good.",14
Wu,And you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. Bye-bye now.,14
Katara,"Okay, okay, but one more thing.",14
Wu,"[  Stares horrified at Katara before sighing and leaning forward slightly in surrender.  ] All right, what is it?",14
Katara,[  Puts a hand to her chin thoughtfully.  ] Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?,14
Wu,[  Angrily.  ] Papaya! [  Slams the door shut.  ],14
Katara,"[  Kicks the ground, sending up a small cloud of dust.  ] Aww, I hate papaya.",14
Aang,"[  Breezily.  ] Oh, hey, Katara. I didn't see you there.",14
Katara,"[  Half-heartedly.  ] Hey, Aang. [  Walks away.  ]",14
Aang,[  Trying to catch her attention.  ] That's okay. I'm busy with my own stuff.,14
Katara,"[  Less than pleased.  ] Ugh, papaya please.",14
Aang,[  Aloof.  ] So ... papaya.,14
Katara,Uh huh. Would you like some?,14
Aang,"[  Causally, picking an apple from the stand.  ] You know me. I don't really care what I eat.",14
Katara,[  Begins walking away.  ] Okay then. See you later.,14
Aang,[  Slightly downcast.  ] Maybe aloof isn't my style.,14
Woman,"[  From afar; delighted.  ] Oh, a panda lily!",14
Aang,[  To Momo.  ] Did you see that?,14
Aang,Excuse me. [  Pointing to the flower.  ] Where can a guy find one of those things?,14
Sokka,[  Off-camera.  ] I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower.,14
Aang,"Not just any flower, a panda lily. I've seen it in action and boy, does it work.",14
Sokka,"Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.",14
Aang,"But my heart is telling me to get this flower, [  Looks up toward the rim of the mountain.  ] and Aunt Wu said if I trusted in my heart, I will be with the one I love.",14
Sokka,"[  Irritated.  ] What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff, too.",14
Aang,"[  Cuts to shot of Aang perched on one boulder, Sokka appearing on-screen.  ] Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love? [  Leaps upward and points in delight at the rim.  ] There! On the rim!",14
Aang,[  Shocked.  ] Oh no. [  Cuts to overhead shot of the volcano.  ] Aunt Wu was wrong.,14
Sokka,Those people all think they're safe! We've got to warn them!,14
Aang,"There's no time to walk! [  Whips out his glider.  ] Grab on! [  He pulls Sokka forward, who shouts in surprise and the two take off.  ]",14
Aang,"[  Shyly, raises hand slightly.  ] Hi, Katara.",14
Katara,[  Annoyed.  ] Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her?,14
Aang,But she doesn't even charge.,14
Katara,"I know, but still ...",14
Sokka,"Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.",14
Katara,"[  Slightly irked, raises finger accusingly.  ] Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my mind -",14
Katara,[  Worriedly.  ] Oh no.,14
Sokka,"[  Urgently.  ] Everyone, that volcano is gonna blow any second! Aunt Wu was wrong!",14
Village Woman,"[  Not buying his claim.  ] Yeah, yeah, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, Mr. science and reason lover.",14
Katara,"[  Stepping forward.  ] If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.",14
Calm man,"[  Unmoved.  ] Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears.",14
Aang,"[  Leaps onto the awning of a nearby building; urgently.  ] Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here! You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction, [  Cuts to shot of villagers who gaze up at him, seemingly listening.  ] you have to take fate into your own hands!",14
Sokka,Look! [  Points to the volcano.  ] Can your fortune telling explain that?,14
Man with Red Shoes,[  Amused.  ] Can your science explain why it rains?,14
Sokka,"[  Turns to him; yells angrily.  ] Yes! Yes, it can!",14
Katara,[  Dismayed.  ] They just won't listen to reason. [  Aang leaps down from the awning.  ],14
Aang,[  Brightening.  ] But they  will  listen to Aunt Wu!,14
Sokka,I know that's the problem.,14
Aang,"Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.",14
Aang,[  Whispering.  ] Shhh! We don't want anyone to hear us.,14
Aang,"Oh, I didn't see you there.",14
Meng,"[  Sadly.  ] You don't like me, do you? [  Her ears droop down.  ]",14
Aang,Of course I like you.,14
Meng,[  Downcast.  ] But not the way I like you.,14
Aang,"Oh, I guess not.",14
Meng,"It's okay. It's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't think of you that way.",14
Aang,[  Casting sad glance to the side.  ] I know what you mean.,14
Meng,"[  Off-camera.  ] She's beautiful, by the way.",14
Aang,"[  Blushes and looks at her, surprised.  ] Huh?",14
Meng,"[  Cuts to shot of the two standing in the room.  ] That Water Tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much. [  Clasps hands together, counts on her fingers.  ] She's sweet, she's a bender [  Cuts to shot of Meng.  ] and her hair seems so manageable. [  While saying this last part, she tries to smooth down her braids only for them to immediately stick up again.  ]",14
Aang,Don't worry. You're going to meet a great guy who's going to completely fall for you. I know it. [  Places a hand on her shoulder comfortingly; turns to leave.  ],14
Meng,"Thanks. [  Holds up hand in alert.  ] Wait! Don't you want this? [  Aang looks surprised; Meng hands him the cloud reading book, revealing she had had it in her possession the whole time.  ]",14
Aang,How did you know?,14
Meng,[  Nervously playing with her fingers.  ] I've kind of been stalking you. [  Smiles sheepishly.  ] Heh ...,14
Aang,"[  Blushing.  ] Oh, thanks ... I guess.",14
Aang,"Clouds are made of water and air, so between the two of us, we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want.",14
Katara,[  Reading Aunt Wu's book.  ] I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom.,14
Sokka,"Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.",14
Wu,[  Quizzically.  ] That's very strange. It shouldn't ... [  A shadow falls over her face as the sky darkens; suddenly terrified.  ] Oh my!,14
Aang,"We still can save the village if we act fast. [  Gesturing toward Sokka, who stands on the pagoda.  ] Sokka has a plan.",14
Sokka,[  Making motions with his arm.  ] Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.,14
Aang,"If any of you are earthbenders, come with me.",14
Poi,[  Raising hand.  ] I'm an earthbender!,14
Ping,[  Raising hand.  ] I'm not!,14
Sokka,"Everybody else grab a shovel [  As another explosion resonates over the village, everyone stumbles before regaining balance.  ] Come on! We've gotta hurry!",14
Sokka,[  Resuming work.  ] Dig faster! Dig faster!,14
Aang,Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!,14
Katara,It's too much! It's gonna overflow!,14
Sokka,"Man, sometimes I forget what a powerful bender that kid is. [  Katara's expression changes at this, remembering Aunt Wu's words about her future marriage.  ]",14
Katara,"Wait, what did you just say?",14
Sokka,"[  Casually.  ] Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.",14
Katara,[  Slowly widens her eyes in realization; as if having an epiphany.  ] I suppose he is.,14
Aang,"[  Sheepishly.  ] By the way, we kind of borrowed your book.",14
Wu,"So you messed with the clouds, did you?",14
Wu,[  Laughs in amusement.  ] Very clever!,14
Sokka,"No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling.",14
Calm man,"[  Cheerfully.  ] But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed and it wasn't. She was right, after all.",14
Sokka,"[  Gets near the Calm man's face, through gritted teeth.  ] I hate you.",14
Katara,"[  Holding Sokka by the shoulders and leading him away.  ] It's okay, Sokka. Everything's going to be all right.",14
Aang,Can I ask you something?,14
Wu,"Of course, honey.",14
Aang,"[  Disappointed.  ] You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me what I wanted to hear.",14
Wu,"I'll tell you a little secret, young airbender. [  Gestures to the sky.  ] Just as you reshaped those clouds, [  Cuts to shot of Aang, who smiles; off-camera.  ] you have the power to shape your own destiny.",14
Katara,"[  Brightly.  ] Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! [  To Meng.  ] Take care, Meng.",14
Meng,"[  Waving.  ] Take care! [  Appa turns away. Cuts to Meng's face, whose smile disappears and is replaced by a frown.  ] Floozy.",14
Aang,"Hey, look! [  Examines the sword.  ] A sword made out of a whale's tooth.",15
Sokka,Let me see that.,15
Sokka,"This is a Water Tribe weapon. [  Turns to Aang, his expression serious.  ] See if you can find anything else.",15
Katara,[  Curiously.  ] Did someone lose something?,15
Aang,"[  Rummaging through the bushes; somewhat cheerfully.  ] No, we found something!",15
Sokka,"It's burned. [  Cut to shot of a tree trunk, scorch marks and sharp cuts running across its bark. Cut to shot of Sokka and the others.  ] There was a battle! Water Tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders. [  He turns away from the tree and looking down the slope of the hill seeing a black spot on the ground.  ] The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill.",15
Aang,"[  Intrigued.  ] So, then what happened?",15
Sokka,[  Disappointed.  ] I don't know. The trail ends here.,15
Katara,"[  Pointing at something in the distance.  ] Wait, look! [  Cut to shot of a Water Tribe ship, half obscured behind large rocks, sitting idly on the shore.  ]",15
Sokka,[  Happily.  ] It's one of our boats!,15
Katara,Is this dad's boat? [  She and Sokka run toward it. Cut to shot of entire ship as they approach.  ],15
Sokka,"No, but it's from his fleet. [  Strokes the boat off, while Aang appears behind them.  ] Dad was here. [  Turns to Katara.  ]",15
Iroh,"[  Exhaling.  ] Aahh! [  Cuts to shot of entire room where he and Zuko are seated at a low-lying table.  ] See Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being. [  Pours Zuko a cup of tea.  ]",15
Firebenders,Look out! Argh!,15
June,[  Holding a rolled up whip.  ] Get back! We're after a stowaway! [  Cut to overhead shot of the ship's deck.  ],15
Zuko,[  Arrives with Iroh.  ] There are no stowaways on my ship.,15
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ] He's paralyzed.,15
June,"Only temporarily. [  Lifts the man and slings him over her shoulder.  ] The toxins will wear off in about an hour. But by then, he'll be in jail and I'll have my money. [  Walks to Nyla.  ]",15
Zuko,But how did you find him on my ship?,15
June,"[  Prepares to mount Nyla, the stowaway already slung onto his back.  ] My shirshu can smell a rat a continent away. [  Mounts her shirshu.  ]",15
Iroh,"Well, I'm impressed. [  June cracks her whip. Cuts to shot of the shirshu bolting off the ship and racing down the dock.  ]  Very  impressed. [  Leaning over the ledge of the ship with Zuko, stroking his beard thoughtfully; Zuko look at him, disgusted.  ]",15
Hakoda,Sokka.,15
Sokka,I'm coming with you.,15
Hakoda,"You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.",15
Sokka,"[  Desperately.  ] I'm strong, I'm brave, I can fight! Please, Dad!",15
Hakoda,"[  Lays a hand on his son's shoulder; grimly and sadly.  ] Being a man is knowing where you're needed the most. And for you right now, that's here, protecting your sister.",15
Sokka,I don't understand. [  His eyes glisten.  ],15
Hakoda,Someday you will. [  Sokka throws aside his bag and throws himself into his father's arms. Cut to close-up of him as he sobs and buries his face in his father's parka.  ] I'm gonna miss you so much.,15
Sokka,"[  Alert.  ] Who's there? [  Stands up, boomerang in hand.  ]",15
Bato,Sokka?,15
Sokka,"[  Quizzically, raising an eyebrow.  ] Bato? [  Spirited.  ]",15
Aang,"[  Having awoken, along with Katara.  ] Who the what now?",15
Katara,[  Cheerfully.  ] Bato!,15
Bato,"[  Cuts to side-shot of Bato, Sokka running over to him, followed closely by Katara.  ] Sokka! Katara! It is so good to see you two. [  Hugs Katara and Sokka.  ] You've grown so much! [  Aang follows them, but remains standing a few feet away.  ]",15
Aang,"[  Bows in greeting.  ] Hi, I'm Aang.",15
Sokka,Where's Dad?,15
Katara,Is he here?,15
Bato,"No, he and the other warriors should be in the Eastern Earth Kingdom by now. [  Both siblings look crestfallen at this news. A gust of wind blows, causing them to shiver. Cut to a shot of Bato who shivers as well.  ] This is no place for a reunion. Let's get inside.",15
Bato,"After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey. The sisters have cared for me ever since. Superior, [  A woman turns around.  ] these are Hakoda's children. They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat.",15
Mother Superior,"Young Avatar, it gives me great joy to be in your presence. Welcome to our abbey.",15
Aang,"Thank you, it's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything- [  Sokka abruptly cuts him off.  ]",15
Sokka,"What smells so good, Bato?",15
Bato,[  Sniffs.  ] The sisters craft ointments and perfumes.,15
Sokka,"Perfume? [  Pointing his thumbs at Appa.  ] Maybe we can dump some on Appa, because he stinks so much. [  Waves his hand in front of his face.  ] Am I right? [  Everyone is silent, a single person coughs.  ]",15
Bato,You have your father's wit.,15
Katara,"Bato, it looks like home! [  Bato, Katara, Sokka, and Aang file inside.  ]",15
Sokka,"Everything's here, even the pelts!",15
Aang,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, nothing's cozier than dead animal skins.",15
Katara,[  Surprised and delighted.  ] No way! Stewed sea prunes!,15
Bato,Help yourself!,15
Sokka,Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things!,15
Katara,"Bato, is it true that you and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?",15
Bato,"It was your father's idea, he just dragged me along. Well, the hippo did the dragging! [  Momo, sitting by Aang, starts to eat the stewed sea prunes that Aang set aside, but ends up spitting it out.  ]",15
Aang,"[  Sokka and Katara are slurping their stewed sea prunes as Aang speaks.  ] Hey, I ride animals, too! There was this one time when I rode a giant eel and I-",15
Sokka,"[  Cutting Aang off.  ] So, who was it that came up with the Great Blubber Fiasco?",15
Bato,[  Chuckles to himself.  ] You knew about that?,15
Katara,Everyone does!,15
Aang,[  Curiously.  ] What's that story?,15
Sokka,"[  Waving Aang off.  ] It's a long one Aang, some other time.",15
Katara,[  To Bato.  ] You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.,15
Bato,"Not all of which were hilarious at the time, but everything's funny in hindsight. [  Chuckling.  ] Hey, Aang! Please put that down, [  Aang is shown wearing a fur pelt on his head.  ] it's ceremonial and very fragile. [  Aang puts the pelt back on the wall, and sits in the back of the room.  ]",15
Sokka,Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit?,15
Bato,"Your dad wore the octopus, [  Lowers his voice.  ] but I did the spooky voice.",15
Zuko,"[  Annoyed.  ] Out of my way! [  Pushing a man out of the way.  ] Step aside, filth!",15
Iroh,[  Apologetically.  ] He means no offense! I'm certain you bathe regularly!,15
Zuko,I need to talk to you!,15
June,"Well, if it isn't my new friends: Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.",15
Zuko,Your beast trashed my ship. You  have  to pay me back!,15
June,"[  As she collects her winnings.  ] Well, I'd love to help you out, but I'm a little short on money. [  To the crowd.  ] Drinks on me! [  The crowd cheers.  ]",15
Zuko,Money isn't what I had in mind.,15
Zuko,I need you to find someone. [  Cut to Katara's necklace.  ],15
June,"[  Sarcastically.  ] What happened, your girlfriend run off on you?",15
Zuko,"It's not the girl I'm after, it's the bald monk she's traveling with.",15
June,[  Unamused.  ] Whatever you say.,15
Zuko,"If you find them, I'll consider the damage to my ship  paid for  .",15
June,"[  Scoffs.  ] Heh, forget it. [  She starts to climb her saddle.  ]",15
Iroh,"Plus, we'll pay your weight in  gold  .",15
June,"[  Stops and widens her eyes in surprise. She smiles. Cut to a side-shot of June walking over to Iroh.  ] Make it  your  [  Pokes his stomach.  ] weight, and we gotta deal.",15
Iroh,[  Laughs with his hand on his stomach.  ] You got it!,15
June,[  As she turns back to Nyla.  ] Get on!,15
Bato,"There's something I should tell you kids. I'm expecting a message from your father. [  Aang is shown with his eyes closed, excluded from the group.  ]",15
Katara,[  Excited.  ] Really?,15
Sokka,[  Slightly demanding.  ] When?,15
Bato,"Any day now. Your father said he'd send a message when they found the rendezvous point. If you wait until the message arrives, you can come with me, and see your father again.",15
Sokka,It's been over two years since we've seen Dad. That would be so incredible! Katara!,15
Katara,"I do really miss him, it would be  great  to see Dad. [  Aang gets up to leave, but no one notices him.  ]",15
Bato,"It's been far too long, hasn't it? [  As Aang leaves.  ] I'm not sure when word will arrive, but when it does-",15
Sokka,"It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first.",15
Katara,"Even if we do have time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel. We don't have time for a long detour.",15
Bato,"I'm sure your father would understand, and be proud that his children are helping the Avatar.",15
Aang,I can't believe they would leave me.,15
Messenger,I'm looking for Bato of the Water Tribe.,15
Aang,"Uhhh, I know Bato!",15
Messenger,Make sure he gets this! [  Hands Aang the scroll and rides away.  ],15
Aang,It's the map to Sokka and Katara's dad!,15
Aang,Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.,15
Katara,"[  Turns to face him.  ] Hey, Aang, I didn't notice you left.",15
Aang,"Yup, but now I'm back. [  Sitting down.  ] Sure could go for some delicious sea prunes!",15
Herbalist,"Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?",15
Zuko,We're looking for someone.,15
Herbalist,"I hope it's not Miyuki [  To Miyuki.  ] Miyuki, did you get in trouble with the Fire Nation, again? [  Miyuki meows.  ]",15
June,The Avatar's been through here. Let's keep moving.,15
Mother Superior,Aha! I caught you. [  Picks up the crumpled paper as Aang looks at her nervously.  ] You should be ashamed of yourself ... Littering in the courtyard.,15
Aang,"[  Takes back the crumpled paper.  ] I'm sorry, I'll take care of this. [  Bows. As Mother Superior walks away, Aang stuffs the map back up his sleeve.  ]",15
Bato,This ship is sentimental to me. It was built by my father.,15
Sokka,[  To Bato.  ] Is this the boat he took you ice dodging in?,15
Bato,Yep! It's got the scar to prove it. Ha. How 'bout you Sokka? You must have some good stories from your first time ice dodging. [  Sokka begins to look saddened.  ],15
Katara,He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough.,15
Bato,"Oh, I forgot you were too young.",15
Aang,What's ice dodging?,15
Bato,"It's a rite of passage for young Water Tribe members. When you turn fourteen, your dad takes you- [  Bato smile and puts his hand on Sokka's shoulder with a new thought.  ] You know what, you're about to find out!",15
Zuko,[  Annoyed.  ] Why are we stopping?,15
June,Because the girl must have spent a lot of time here.,15
Zuko,We have no time for this!,15
Zuko,Hey! Watch it!,15
June,"[  As Iroh laughs from behind her.  ] Oh look, he likes you!",15
Aunt Wu,"Care to hear your fortune, handsome?",15
Iroh,"At my age, there's really only one big surprise left, and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.",15
Bato,"Ice dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery, and trust. [  Shot changes to on the boat.  ] In our village, ice dodging was done by weaving a boat through a field of icebergs.",15
Sokka,How are we supposed to ice dodge without ice?,15
Bato,"You'll be dodging those. [  Points to a group of tall, sharp, jagged rocks near the shore. Katara and Sokka appear nervous.  ] Sokka, you steer and call the shots, lead wisely. Katara, you secure the main sail. [  Katara grabs a rope.  ] The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the jib. Without your steady hand, we all go down. Your position is about trust.",15
Aang,"[  Blinks. Defensively.  ] I know that. Why wouldn't I know that? [  Folds his arms.  ] I'm the Avatar; I know about trust. [  He crosses his arms and looks away, but gives Bato a second glance.  ]",15
Bato,"For this is to be done right, I cannot help. [  Sits cross-legged at the front of the boat.  ] You pass or fail on your own.",15
Sokka,"[  Studies the rocky shores.  ] Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady. [  Katara looks at the shore with concern.  ] Aang, less sail. Katara, give him room. [  The ship moves to the side and sails between some rocks.  ] Aang, helm to lee. Helm to lee!",15
Aang,What does that even mean?,15
Sokka,Great job!,15
Katara,There's no way through!,15
Sokka,We can make it.,15
Bato,"[  Stands up and grabs the side of the boat.  ] Sokka, you've already proven yourself. Maybe we should-",15
Sokka,"Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail. [  Aang nods.  ] Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks. Now!",15
Bato,"[  Dips his fingers in the paint.  ] The spirits of water bear witness to these marks. For Sokka, the Mark of the Wise. [  Uses his thumb to put an arc and small dot on Sokka's forehead.  ] The same mark your father earned. For Katara, [  Uses his thumb to put a crescent moon mark on Katara's forehead.  ] the Mark of the Brave. Your courage inspires us. [  Using his thumb to put an arc on Aang's forehead.  ] And for Aang, the Mark of the Trusted. You are now an honorary member of the Water Tribe.",15
Aang,I can't. [  Looks down.  ],15
Katara,Of course you can!,15
Aang,"[  Rubbing off his mark and backing away.  ] No, you can't trust me.",15
Katara,"[  Concerned.  ] Aang, what are you talking about?",15
Aang,[  Takes the crumpled map out of his sleeve.  ] A messenger gave this to me for Bato. [  Katara takes it from him.  ] You  have  to understand. I was afraid you would-,15
Sokka,"[  Angrily.  ] This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time? How could you? [  Aang shrugs his shoulders.  ] Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own. I'm going to find Dad. [  Walks away.  ]",15
Bato,"Well, Sokka. I think you should-",15
Sokka,"[  Turns back.  ] Katara, are you with me?",15
Katara,[  Turns to look at Aang and closes her eyes.  ] I'm with you Sokka.,15
Katara,Good luck.,15
Aang,Okay. You too.,15
Aang,Guess I should be moving on.,15
Mother Superior,That would be best.,15
Aang,"I'm an idiot, Momo. [  Momo chitters.  ]",15
June,"We're getting close. [  Whips Nyla, who runs out of the abbey and into the woods.  ]",15
Katara,[  To Sokka.  ] That wolf sounds so sad.,15
Sokka,It's probably wounded.,15
Bato,"[  Turns back to them.  ] No, it's been separated from the pack. I understand that pain. It's how I felt when the Water Tribe warriors had to leave me behind. They were my family, [  Shot of Sokka, who looks sadly at the camera.  ] and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds.",15
Katara,Sokka?,15
Sokka,"We need to go back. I wanna see Dad, but, helping Aang is where we're needed the most.",15
Katara,[  Smiles.  ] You're right.,15
Bato,"[  Walks up to Katara and Sokka and puts his arms on their shoulders.  ] Your father will understand, and I know he's proud of you.",15
Sokka,"Thanks, Bato.",15
Bato,I know where to go from here. [  Takes the map from out of his Water Tribe outfit.  ] Take this in case you want to find us. I'll leave a message at the rendezvous point.,15
Aang,"Looks like we're going alone, guys.",15
Mother Superior,"[  Runs on camera. Desperately.  ] Avatar, you must leave!",15
Aang,"[  Annoyed.  ] Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.",15
Mother Superior,A group of people came to the abbey looking for you.,15
Aang,Who?,15
Mother Superior,"A fierce looking woman with a horrible monster, and a young man with a scar.",15
Aang,Zuko.,15
Mother Superior,The beast was using the scent of a necklace to follow you.,15
Aang,A necklace? [  Gasps.  ] Katara!,15
June,"[  To Zuko.  ] So this is your girlfriend. [  Zuko jumps down.  ] No wonder she left, she's way too pretty for you.",15
Zuko,[  To Sokka and Katara.  ] Where is he? Where is the Avatar?,15
Sokka,We split up. He's long gone.,15
Zuko,How stupid do you think I am?,15
Sokka,Pretty stupid. [  Grabs his sister.  ] Run!,15
Zuko,What are we supposed to do now?,15
June,[  Nyla walks closer to Sokka and Katara.  ] It's seeking a different scent. Perhaps something that the Avatar held.,15
Zuko,What's it doing? It's just going in a circle.,15
Katara,[  Looks up.  ] Aang!,15
June,Up! [  June cracks her whip. Nyla stands up and June mounts him.  ],15
June,[  Whips Nyla.  ] Come on! Get up!,15
Sokka,I'm ... starting to get some feeling back! [  Rubble from the roof falls on him.  ] Ow.,15
Aang,You've got something I want.,15
Sokka,That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at.,15
Mother Superior,The perfume?,15
Iroh,"[  Nyla paralyzes Zuko as Iroh looks at Nyla in concern.  ] June! No! [  Nyla tongue lashes out and hits June, who falls back into Iroh's arms.  ]",15
Zuko,Uncle? I didn't see you get hit with the tongue.,15
Iroh,Shhh.,15
Aang,So ... where do we go?,15
Katara,We're getting  you  to the North Pole.,15
Sokka,"Yeah, we've lost too much time as it is.",15
Aang,[  Turns to the group.  ] Don't you want to see your father?,15
Sokka,"Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family, too. And right now, you need us more.",15
Katara,And  we  need you.,15
Aang,"I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you ...",15
Katara,I'll be okay.,15
Aang,"Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like ... [  Holds up Katara's necklace.  ] this? [  Closer shot of the necklace.  ]",15
Katara,"[  Takes the necklace.  ] Aang, how'd you get that?",15
Aang,Zuko asked me to be  sure  I got it to you.,15
Katara,"Aw, that's so sweet of Zuko. Could you give him a kiss for me when you see him?",15
Aang,Sure.,15
Katara,"So, how long do you think it's been since someone was here?",15
Sokka,Long enough for moss to grow on the hull. [  He turns to Katara; unsure.  ] About three months.,15
Katara,"[  Close-up of Katara; disappointed.  ] Oh. [  She looks down, saddened.  ] So dad's probably long gone.",15
Sokka,[  Cut to a shot from behind Aang.  ] I wonder why they left this boat? There's nothing wrong with it.,15
Aang,When was the last time you saw your dad?,15
Sokka,[  He turns away.  ] I don't want to talk about it.,15
Aang,[  The camera cuts to a frontal of Aang.  ] Sorry. [  He looks down in guilt.  ] I didn't mean to bring that up.,15
Katara,"[  Shot of Katara and Aang around the campfire.  ] It's okay Aang. Our dad left about two years ago, with all the other Water Tribe men.",15
Sokka,[  Sokka enters the shot and proceeds to lay down in front of the campfire; interrupting Katara.  ] Maybe we should all get some sleep.,15
Katara,"[  Walking toward a poster on the kiosk, present in the middle of a crossroad.  ] This should give us a good idea of what's around here.",16
Sokka,"[  Flips a small pouch to find it empty aside from a few crumbs.  ] See if you can find a menu, I'm starving! [  Wipes his mouth.  ]",16
Aang,"I bet we'll find something to eat here, [  Pointing at the poster.  ] the Fire Day's Festival. [  Momo jumps down. Aang begins reading-out the poster.  ] Fire Nation cultural exhibits, jugglers, benders, magicians ... [  Turns to Katara.  ] This would be a great place for me to study some real firebenders.",16
Sokka,[  Looking at another poster on the other side of the kiosk; seriously.  ] You might wanna rethink that. Look at this.,16
Aang,"[  Comes over to at the poster.  ] Hey, a poster of me!",16
Sokka,A wanted poster! This is bad. [  Aang removes the poster from the wall and starts reading it.  ],16
Katara,[  Stares at the wanted poster.  ] I think we better keep moving.,16
Aang,[  Looking at Katara.  ] I have to learn firebending at some point and this could be my only chance to watch a master's up close.,16
Katara,[  Swayed by Aang; while her head is bowed.  ] I guess we could go check it out. [  Aang begins rejoicing.  ],16
Sokka,"[  Moves in front of Katara; in an opposing tone.  ] What? You wanna walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired-up with their ... you know, fire? [  Aang becomes serious again.  ]",16
Katara,"[  Starts walking toward Appa and is followed by Aang.  ] We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.",16
Sokka,[  Not convinced; sarcastically.  ] Yeah! Because we always leave before we get into trouble.,16
Aang,[  To Appa and Momo.  ] You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival. [  To Katara and Sokka.  ] Ready disguises!,16
Sokka,[  Sarcastically at Aang's goofy disguise.  ] It's like you're a whole different person ... [  Katara giggles.  ],16
Aang,Let's go.,16
Katara,I think we need some new disguises.,16
Sokka,Where are we gonna get masks like that?,16
Mask dealer,Get your genuine Fire Festival masks here!,16
Sokka,That was surprisingly easy.,16
Aang,"Hey, there's some food.",16
Sokka,Finally! [  To the shop keeper.  ] What do you have?,16
Shop keeper,Flaming fire flakes! Best in town.,16
Sokka,I'll take'em!,16
Sokka,Aaahhh! Hot! Hot!,16
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] ""Flaming fire flakes"", hot? What do you know?",16
Aang,"Hey, look at this.",16
Puppet Fire Lord,Don't worry loyal citizens! No one can surprise the Fire Lord!,16
Fire Nation kids,"[  As an Earth Kingdom general puppet pops up behind the Fire Lord's puppet, with a rock ready to attack.  ] Oh no! Look out! [  The puppet breaths fire, burning the other puppet.  ]",16
Katara,"Aang, hold on! Where are we going?",16
Aang,"I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.",16
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.",16
Aang,I gotta learn that trick!,16
Malu,Thank you! For my next trick I need a volunteer from the audience!,16
Aang,[  Waving his hand up in the air all around childishly.  ] Oh! Oh! Me! Me!,16
Sokka,[  In a stern tone while pulling his arm down.  ] What do you think you're doing?,16
Aang,I want to get a closer look.,16
Katara,It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.,16
Malu,"How about you, little lady?",16
Katara,[  While backing away.  ] Uh.,16
Malu,"Awww, she's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!",16
Aang,[  In a jealous tone while folding his arms.  ] Awww! That could've been me.,16
Malu,"This next trick is called ""Taming the Dragon."" [  While sitting her down in a chair and tying her to it.  ] You will be my captured princess! Don't worry, young maiden! I will tame this fiery beast! It's too strong, I can't hold it!",16
Aang,We gotta help her!,16
Sokka,"No, we don't want to make a scene!",16
Malu,"The rope, it's breaking! [  Aang saves Katara with his airbending, dispersing the flames is a ray of colors while he loses his mask in the process.  ] Hey, you tryin' to upstage me, kid?",16
Citizen,Hey! That kid's the Avatar! [  Aang stops dancing and runs.  ],16
Sokka,I think it's time to go.,16
Chey,Follow me! I can get you outta here! [  The kids follow Chey.  ],16
Guard,There they are!,16
Guard,Over there!,16
Aang,I'm calling Appa. [  Aang blows his whistle.  ],16
Sokka,I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!,16
Chey,[  Making a sharp turn down one of the several alleys.  ] This way! [  Comes running back.  ] Okay! Not this way!,16
Aang,Appa! Down here!,16
Aang,Nice touch setting off the fireworks.,16
Sokka,[  Impressed.  ] You really know your explosives ...,16
Chey,I'm familiar.,16
Sokka,You're a Fire Nation Soldier!,16
Chey,Was.  My name's Chey.,16
Chey,"I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend, Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral?",16
Sokka,"[  Not amused.  ] He was very highly ranked, we get it.",16
Chey,"Yeah! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more. He's the first person ever to leave the army - and live. I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though. Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius. Some say he's mad - but he's not! He's enlightened.",16
Aang,You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord? [  Gets up in excitement.  ] We've gotta go see him! He can train me!,16
Sokka,[  Snaps at Aang.  ] We're  not  gonna go find some  crazy  firebender!,16
Chey,[  Annoyed; Stands up to gesture.  ] He's not crazy! He's a genius! And he's the perfect person to train the Avatar! That's why I followed you into the festival.,16
Sokka,"Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the North Pole in the morning.",16
Aang,"Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me.",16
Katara,It can't hurt just to talk to him.,16
Sokka,[  Very annoyed.  ] That's what you said about going to the festival! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?,16
Lin Yee,Don't move!,16
Lin Yee,[  Angry.  ] Jeong Jeong told you not to look for Avatar!,16
Sokka,"Hold on, you know these guys?",16
Chey,"Oh yeh! Lin Yee's an old buddy! Right, Lin Yee?",16
Lin Yee,[  Not amused with Chey.  ] Shut up! Keep moving.,16
Lin Yee,Go on. He sees you only.,16
Chey,"Oh that's okay, we can chat later.",16
Aang,Is that where Jeong Jeong is? I need to talk to him right away.,16
Lin Yee,No! You wait there. [  Pushes Chey forward.  ] Go now!,16
Chey,"Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. He's a great man, great man!",16
Zhao,"So, the Avatar was here and you let him slip away?",16
Guard captain,"[  Anxiously.  ] Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went off without a hitch! [  A huge piece of burning planks of wood falls in the background with a massive crash making the guards twitch.  ] No fights. Theft was way down.",16
Zhao,[  Irritated.  ] I don't care about your local crime rates! Which way did they go?,16
Guard captain,"They headed into the forest, up the river I suspect.",16
Zhao,Ready the river boats. We're going after the Avatar.,16
Aang,What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?,16
Chey,[  Looking downcast.  ] He won't see you. He's very angry that I brought you here. He wants you to leave immediately.,16
Sokka,Finally! Let's hit the road. [  He stretches back out again.  ],16
Aang,Why won't he see me?,16
Chey,He says you're not ready. Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet.,16
Aang,"[  Shocked.  ] Wait, how does he know that?",16
Chey,He saw the way you walked into camp. He could tell.,16
Aang,"I'm going in, anyway!",16
Jeong Jeong,Get out.,16
Aang,"Master, I need to learn firebending.",16
Jeong Jeong,Only a fool seeks his own destruction.,16
Aang,"[  To Jeong Jeong.  ] I'm the Avatar, it's my destiny to— [  Gets interrupted.  ]",16
Jeong Jeong,"Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny? If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny? No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control! He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean.",16
Aang,"Okay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.",16
Jeong Jeong,"To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself. But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out.",16
Aang,"Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance.",16
Jeong Jeong,"Are you deaf? How can I teach you if you refuse to listen? Before learning firebending you must learn water and earth. Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady and stable, but fire, fire is alive! It breathes, it grows. Without the bender, a rock will not throw itself! But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one does not have the will to control it! That is its destiny! You are not ready! You are too weak!",16
Roku,You think I am weak?,16
Jeong Jeong,"Avatar Roku! No, No! I did not mean that.",16
Roku,"I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes. Now, I must do it once again. You will teach the Avatar [  He raises his hand and ignites the tree behind Jeong Jeong.  ] firebending.",16
Jeong Jeong,"Yes, yes, I will teach you.",16
Aang,Really? That's great! [  Raises his hands happily; Jeong Jeong groans in dismay fearing this may not end well.  ],16
Jeong Jeong,"Widen your stance. Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate. [  Aang expresses his concentration.  ] Good, good!",16
Aang,Wait! What do I do now?,16
Jeong Jeong,"[  Turns around.  ] Silence! Talking is not concentrating! Look at your friend, is she talking? [  Points at Sokka.  ] Even that oaf knows to concentrate on what he's doing!",16
Sokka,[  Annoyed.  ]  Hey  !,16
Aang,But what am I concentrating on?,16
Jeong Jeong,"Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire. Yet, it is in complete balance with nature!",16
Aang,So when do I get to make some fire?,16
Jeong Jeong,Concentrate!,16
Aang,Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?,16
Jeong Jeong,No fire yet.,16
Aang,What?,16
Jeong Jeong,Power in firebending comes from the breath. That is why you must master proper breath control.,16
Aang,You brought me up here to breathe?,16
Jeong Jeong,Assume your stance.,16
Jeong Jeong,[  Faces the opposite direction of Aang.  ] Wider.,16
Aang,You're not even look— [  Interrupted by Jeong Jeong.  ],16
Jeong Jeong,"Wider!  Now, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth - without talking. Good. Keep going.",16
Jeong Jeong,What are you doing here? I did not tell you to stop!,16
Aang,I've been breathing for hours!,16
Jeong Jeong,You want to stop breathing?,16
Aang,I want you to stop wasting my time! I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun! [  Wiggles fingers to the ceiling to gesture this.  ] I wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!,16
Jeong Jeong,"[  Sighs gruffly.  ] I had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline. He was only concerned with the power of fire - how he could use it to destroy his opponents and wipe out the obstacles in his path, but fire is a horrible burden to bear. Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it. [  While he was speaking, the camera cuts to Zhao on his boat; several men attack him, but he fends them off easily, leaving a fire in his wake. Cuts back to Jeong Jeong.  ]",16
Jeong Jeong,"Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love.",16
Aang,"I thought about what you said, I promise I'll be more patient.",16
Jeong Jeong,We're going to work with fire now.,16
Aang,"Oh yeah! [  Aang gets excited and airbends himself into the air. He quickly gets serious again.  ] I mean, let us begin.",16
Jeong Jeong,Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep the flame from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can.,16
Tribal man,Master! There is trouble.,16
Aang,What's going on?,16
Jeong Jeong,Concentrate on your leaf!,16
Aang,[  Annoyed.  ] This is the  worst  firebending instruction ever! All he does is leave me for hours to concentrate or breathe!,16
Katara,I'm sure there's a good reason.,16
Aang,But I'm ready to do so much more.,16
Aang,[  Excited.  ] I did it! I made fire!,16
Katara,"Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.",16
Aang,Now  that's  some firebending!,16
Katara,"Aang, you'll hurt yourself!",16
Aang,I wonder how that juggler did it.,16
Aang,Katara! I'm so sorry!,16
Sokka,"[  Concerned.  ] Katara, what's wrong? [  Angrily.  ] What did you do?!",16
Aang,"It was an accident! I was, uh... Katara, I'm so--",16
Sokka,[  Enraged.  ] I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did!  You burned my sister  ! [  Katara runs away.  ] You burned my sister! [  As Jeong Jeong walks in.  ] This is all your fault!,16
Jeong Jeong,I know! Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.,16
Aang,"I'm sorry, I didn't ... [  Sokka runs off.  ] I'm sorry! [  Jeong Jeong looks at Aang, displeased.  ]",16
Jeong Jeong,You have healing abilities. The great benders of the Water Tribe sometimes have this ability. I've always wished I were blessed like you - free from this burning curse.,16
Katara,But you're a great master. You have powers that I will never know.,16
Jeong Jeong,"Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart.",16
Jeong Jeong,Go get your friends and flee! Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!,16
Zhao,"Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago. [  The screen pans to Jeong Jeong. Suddenly, Zhao parts through the wall.  ] Haven't you, Master Jeong Jeong?",16
Sokka,Katara! Are you all right?,16
Katara,"I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang? [  Sokka gestures to the cottage.  ]",16
Aang,Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.,16
Katara,You'll have to eventually.,16
Aang,"No, never again.",16
Katara,"It's okay, Aang. I'm healed.",16
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] What? How?,16
Katara,"I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!",16
Aang,[  Gets on his feet.  ] Where?,16
Katara,By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.,16
Aang,I have to help him!,16
Zhao,Look at you. You were once so great. I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage.,16
Jeong Jeong,"It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao.",16
Zhao,"It's Admiral Zhao, now.",16
Jeong Jeong,That title will not help you against the Avatar. Do not try to fight him! You are no match!,16
Zhao,[  Amused.  ] I think I can handle a child.,16
Jeong Jeong,I have never seen such raw power ...,16
Aang,Jeong Jeong!,16
Zhao,We'll see. Men! Take the deserter!,16
Zhao,[  Angry.  ] It's a trick! He's run off into the woods. Find him! [  Faces Aang.  ] Let's find out what my old master has taught you.,16
Aang,[  Shocked.  ] You were Jeong Jeong's student?!,16
Zhao,Until I got bored.,16
Zhao,I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward. But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of! [  Throws another intense fireball.  ],16
Aang,Whoa! Wild shot!,16
Zhao,[  Roars with rage.  ] I'll show you  wild  !,16
Aang,No self-control ... [  Gets an idea.  ],16
Zhao,"Stand and fight, Avatar!",16
Aang,"[  Mockingly.  ] Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up!",16
Zhao,[  Burns in anger at the remark.  ] I was ... [  Shoots another fireball.  ],16
Aang,"Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days! [  Nearly gets blasted.  ] [  Aang cups his hands over his to sound louder.  ] Ahoy! [  Shakes his butt at Zhao.  ] I'm Admiral Zhao! [  Zhao gets even angrier and Aang nearly gets blasted again.  ] I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko. [  Aang looks disappointed when he says this. His eyes go wide and he lies down on the deck fast enough to avoid being burnt. Mocking Zhao's firebending.  ] Sloppy. Very sloppy.",16
Zhao,"Nowhere to run now, you little smart mouth!",16
Aang,[  Having dodged a series of blasts from Zhao on several ships.  ] You've lost this battle.,16
Zhao,[  Enraged disbelief.  ] Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!,16
Aang,"No  , but  you  have. [  He gestures around, all the boats are on fire and sinking.  ] Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint. [  Jumps in the water.  ] Have a nice walk home!",16
Sokka,"Aang, come on! Let's go!",16
Aang,Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?,16
Sokka,He disappeared. They all did.,16
Chey,"[  Walks into the now abandoned village; not amused.  ] Hey, where did everybody go? [  Sarcastically.  ] Very funny guys",16
Katara,"Aang, you're burned! Let me help you. [  Katara heals the burn on Aang's arm.  ]",16
Aang,"Wow, that's good water.",16
Sokka,When did you learn that?,16
Katara,I guess I always knew.,16
Sokka,[  Sarcastically.  ] Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble. [  Angrily.  ] Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb!,16
Aang,[  Shocked.  ] Two?,16
Katara,[  Amused.  ] He tried to get the first fishhook out with another fishhook.,16
Sokka,"[  Still being sarcastic.  ] Oh, and the time that mink snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.",16
Storyteller,"[  Dramatically; out of view.  ] So, travelers. The next time you think you hear a strange, large bird talking, take a closer look. It might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man. A member of a secret group of air walkers, who laugh at gravity, and laugh at those bound to the earth by it!",17
Aang,"[  Cuts to a wide shot, showing the gang and the other travelers surrounding a small campfire. The Storyteller, having finished his story, is going around collecting coins from the other travelers.  ] Aren't airbender stories the greatest? [  Talking to Katara and Sokka, who are sitting next to him.  ]",17
Katara,[  Excitedly.  ] Was it realistic? Is that how it was back then?,17
Aang,I laugh at gravity all the time. [  Chuckling to himself.  ] Gravity.,17
Storyteller,"[  Arrives in front of the gang, having already collected money from the rest of the audience.  ] Jingle, jingle! [  Jingles the hat in front of Sokka, asking for money.  ]",17
Sokka,Sorry ...,17
Storyteller,"[  Upset and somewhat downcast.  ] Aww, cheapskates! [  Walks away as Sokka puts the bugs back in his pocket.  ]",17
Aang,[  Happily.  ] Hey! Thanks for the story.,17
Storyteller,"[  Holds out his cap.  ] Tell it to the cap,  boy.",17
Storyteller,"Aww, much obliged, little bat-thing. [  He pets Momo on the head.  ]",17
Aang,[  Having given up trying to find a coin.  ] It means a lot to hear airbender stories. It must have been a hundred years ago your great grandpa met them.,17
Storyteller,"[  Confused.  ] What are you prattling about, child? Great Grandpappy saw the air walkers last week. [  He indicates to the old man he was kneeling in front of before. The old man makes a sound in his throat akin to a laugh, and waves a greeting to Aang. The shot cuts to Aang, who has a shocked and disbelieving expression.  ]",17
Aang,"[  Sitting on Appa's neck, steering. He is talking to Katara and Sokka, who are riding in Appa's saddle.  ] Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple. This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo.",17
Katara,[  Moving to sit at the back of the saddle with her brother.  ] Do you think we'll really find airbenders?,17
Sokka,"[  He is whittling a piece of wood. The design is indecipherable.  ] You want me to be like you, or totally honest?",17
Katara,"[  Crossing her arms, obviously angry with him.  ] Are you saying I'm a liar?",17
Sokka,"[  He shrugs, unconcerned with her mood.  ] I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing, basically.",17
Aang,"[  Excitedly.  ] Hey, guys, look at this!",17
Katara,[  Amazed.  ] They really are airbenders!,17
Aang,"[  His face falls as he sees the 'airbenders', and after Katara's excited outburst, he leans back and scowls while crossing his arms.  ] No, they're not.",17
Sokka,"[  Exuberantly.  ] What do you mean ""they're not""? Those guys are flying!",17
Aang,"[  Bitterly. He is glaring at the direction of the people flying around the temple.  ] Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move, they're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.",17
Katara,"I don't know, Aang.[  Katara points to the boy.  ] That kid seemed pretty spirited. [  Katara indicates to the boy, who is flying dangerously close, but still laughing.  ]",17
Sokka,"We better find some solid ground, before it finds us. [  The siblings land Appa on the temple courtyard, out of the hazardous sky. Aang is still flying with the boy, and seems to be having fun at the surprise competition.  ]",17
Colonists,"[  Several children are on the ground, cheering on their friend.  ] Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!",17
Teo,"[  The boy doesn't seem upset at Aang, and seems happy that he isn't angry for nearly flying into him.  ] Hey there, you're pretty good!",17
Aang,"[  Nonchalantly, but with a smirk.  ] Yeah, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding.",17
Teo,"[  He is looking amazed, before thinking of his own plan.  ] Wow, I don't think I can do that. But here's a good one.",17
Teo,What do you think?,17
Aang,[  Annoyed; his face mimics the one Teo has just drawn.  ] It's great.,17
Teo,"Hey, you're a real airbender. You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I-I've heard stories about you!",17
Aang,"[  Rubs his head, embarrassed.  ] Thanks.",17
Sokka,"[  Sokka ignores all formalities, instead going over to Teo's chair and examining the strange shape and design.  ] Wow! This glider chair is incredible!",17
Teo,"You think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my dad designed.",17
Sokka,Wow! [  Runs up to machines.  ],17
Teo,"Yeah, my dad is the mastermind behind this whole place. Everything's powered by hot air. [  Shows women using an elevator like contraption.  ] It even pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift while we're gliding.",17
Aang,[  Monotonously.  ] This place is unbelievable.,17
Teo,"Yeah, it's great, isn't it?",17
Aang,"No, just unbelievable. [  Walks away.  ]",17
Katara,"[  Katara approaches Teo, who seems disappointed at Aang's reaction.  ] Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so ... different.",17
Sokka,So better!,17
Aang,This is supposed to be the history of my people.,17
Aang,Ugh!,17
Katara,[  Walks up and puts her hand on his shoulder.  ] I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.,17
Aang,It's nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isn't ruined.,17
Man,[  Off-screen.  ] Look out!,17
Mechanist,"What the doodle? Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites? We have to make room for the bathhouse! [  He has approached Aang and the group, looking more surprised than upset.  ]",17
Aang,[  He turns to the mechanist and yells angrily at him.  ] Do you know what you did!? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse!,17
Mechanist,"Well, people around here are starting to stink. [  Waves his hand in front of his face, as though trying to dissipate a bad smell.  ]",17
Aang,"[  Points at the mechanist.  ] This whole place stinks! [  Using his airbending, Aang flips the crane contraption off of the edge of the building.  ]",17
Aang,This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way! [  Walks closer to the mechanist.  ] I've seen it when the monks were here! I know what it's supposed to be like!,17
Mechanist,"The monks? But, [  Scratches his beard.  ] you're twelve.",17
Teo,"[  Teo rolls up.  ] Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.",17
Aang,What are you doing? Who said you could be here?,17
Mechanist,"[  Turns away from Aang.  ] Hmm, doing here ... A long time ago, [  Points finger up.  ] but not a hundred years, my people became refugees [  Walks behind his son's wheelchair.  ] after a terrible flood. My infant son, [  Teo looks down sadly.  ] Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother. [  Sniffles.  ] I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place. Couldn't believe it! Everywhere! Pictures of flying people! But empty, [  Looks around.  ] nobody home. Then, [  Does a airplane like gesture, like he's flying up to Aang.  ] I came across these fan-like contraptions!",17
Aang,Our gliders.,17
Mechanist,"Yes! Little, light flying machines! [  Waves his hands up and down.  ] They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air! Then everyone will be on equal ground! So to speak. We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here. [  Katara wipes her tears on Aang's shirt, and Sokka looks like he's holding back tears.  ] And, after all, isn't that what nature does?",17
Aang,Nature knows where to stop.,17
Mechanist,"I suppose that's true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us. Look at the time! [  Points at candles.  ] Come! [  To other workers.  ] The pulley system must be oiled before dark.",17
Sokka,"Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same.",17
Mechanist,The candle will tell us. Watch. [  Candle pops four times.  ],17
Sokka,You put spark powder in the candle!,17
Mechanist,"Four flashes. So it's exactly four hours past mid-day. Or, as I call it: four o'candle. [  Sokka laughs. Cut to a frontal shot of the mechanist, pleased that Sokka is interested.  ] If you like that, wait till you see my finger-safe knife sharpener. [  He holds up his left hand, revealing that three of the fingers are made of wood.  ] Only took me three tries to get it right. [  He pulls off the three wooden fingers, and throws them into Sokka's hand.  ]",17
Sokka,[  Horrified.  ] Aaah!,17
Mechanist,[  Pokes Sokka in the back with his one remaining finger and gestures for him to come.  ] Follow me! [  Sokka runs after him.  ],17
Teo,"Hey, Aang. I want to show you something.",17
Aang,I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.,17
Teo,I don't know about that. The temple might be different [  Picks up hermit crab from the ground.  ] but the creatures that live here [  Hands it to Katara.  ] are probably direct descendants of the ones who lived here a long time ago.,17
Katara,[  Pokes hermit crab.  ] You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temple's origins. [  Katara hands it to Aang. It moves around in his hand and he smiles.  ],17
Teo,"Besides, there's one part of the temple that hasn't changed at all.",17
Katara,"Hey, it's just like the one in the other temple!",17
Teo,"[  Confidently, with a matter-of-fact tone.  ] Only an airbender can open it, so inside it's completely untouched. Just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it's like in there ...",17
Katara,"[  She looks at him, as though slightly scared of his reaction. Her tone is gentle and questioning.  ] Aang?",17
Aang,[  He turns away from the door and his friends.  ] I'm sorry. This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was. I want it to stay that way.,17
Teo,"[  Somewhat disappointed, although he tries not to let it show.  ] I completely understand. I just wanted you to know that it's here.",17
Aang,Thanks. [  All three start to walk away.  ],17
Sokka,These lanterns are terrible. I can't see! [  Opens the top of his lantern only to find them filled with fireflies.  ] Why would you want to use fireflies for light? [  One flies out.  ],17
Mechanist,Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose! [  Sokka closes it.  ] Fireflies are a non-flammable light source. [  Both begin to walk again.  ],17
Mechanist,"Cover your nose [  Both plug their noses.  ] and hold your breath. [  The mechanist opens an eye slot in the door, both look inside a pitch-black room.  ]",17
Sokka,"[  Nasally, due to his nose being blocked.  ] Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.",17
Mechanist,"[  Closes eye slot.  ] Wrong. It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly blew my self and the whole place even more sky high! Thought my eyebrows would never grow back. [  Pans up to his eyebrows.  ] Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time, we have gas leaks. And they're nearly impossible to find.",17
Sokka,"So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen.",17
Mechanist,"Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell, or touch.",17
Teo,The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you. Something even lighter than air. [  Shows Katara holding a glider and standing at the edge of a building.  ] And that something takes over when you fly. [  Katara puts down her glider and looks up at the other people flying.  ],17
Katara,[  Nervously.  ] I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something.,17
Teo,[  Laughs.  ] Impossible! Everybody has it!,17
Aang,Spirit.,17
Teo,What?,17
Aang,Spirit. That's the something you're talking about.,17
Teo,"[  Thoughtfully.  ] Yeah, I suppose it is.",17
Teo,Are you ready?,17
Katara,"No! [  Jumps off anyway.  ] Aaaaah! [  Starts to fall down wards, but eventually starts to fly straight. Her scream peters off as she begins laughing.  ] I can't believe I'm flying!",17
Aang,Just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug! [  Shows Momo flying by and eating a bug.  ],17
Katara,"Teo was right about the air. All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me.",17
Aang,"Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one! [  Aang lands beside him on the building.  ] I've been thinking. If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.",17
Teo,Great!,17
Katara,"Wait! [  Katara flies by.  ] How do I land this thing? What if I land over [  Swallows a bug.  ] a-ack-ack-bleck! Bug! Bug! Ack, that was a bug!",17
Mechanist,"I said don't touch anything! [  Comes over to help Sokka pick things up.  ] Oh, don't worry. That experiment's old, [  Referring to the hot air balloon.  ] and that egg was just part of last week's lunch.",17
Sokka,[  He sniffs the air before wincing.  ] Ugh! Week old egg smell!,17
Mechanist,"Quick, find that egg! [  Both crawl around the floor looking for it.  ]",17
Teo,I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside!,17
Sokka,How can something so small that you can't even see it make such a big stink!?,17
Mechanist,That's the solution to our problem!,17
Sokka,Yeah ... [  Both turn toward each other.  ] if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up ...,17
Mechanist,... The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs!,17
Sokka,"Then, if there's a leak ...",17
Mechanist,"... You smell rotten eggs! Then, you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from ...",17
Sokka,And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!,17
Both,You're a genius! [  Bell rings on one of his desks.  ],17
Mechanist,Something's wrong. [  Stands up.  ] I've go to go! [  Runs out the door and Sokka follows.  ],17
Aang,This is a nightmare.,17
Mechanist,[  Walks in with Sokka behind him.  ] You don't understand!,17
Aang,[  Accusingly.  ] You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!,17
Sokka,[  Angrily.  ] You make weapons for the Fire Nation?!,17
Teo,Explain all this! Now!,17
Mechanist,"[  He is hesitant, but resigned as he begins to explain.  ] It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement. You were too young to remember this, Teo. They were going to destroy everything! Burn it to the ground! I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us! They asked what I had to offer. I offered ... my services. You must understand. I did this for you!",17
Aang,When are they coming?,17
Mechanist,Soon. [  Candle pops once.  ] Very soon.,17
Aang,You can't give them more weapons.,17
Mechanist,"If I don't give them what they want, they will destroy this place! [  The model of the hot air balloon catches fire and crashes. The mechanist puts the fire out with a cloth.  ]",17
Teo,How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?,17
Mechanist,I need some time to think. [  Bell rings on his desk.  ] You need to leave! Go!,17
Teo,We're not leaving!,17
Mechanist,"Then hide! Quickly! [  They hide behind some of his inventions. the mechanist pulls a rope that opens a trapdoor, and a war minister from the Fire Nation is lifted into the room.  ]",17
Qin,You know better than to keep me waiting. Give me what you owe us so we can be on our way. [  The mechanist looks down.  ] Well? Is there a problem?,17
Mechanist,"[  Hurredly.  ] No, right this way. [  Gestures toward the door.  ]",17
Aang,The deal's off.,17
Qin,The Avatar ...,17
Mechanist,"Aang, don't get involved!",17
Qin,"If I don't get what I came here for, the Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble!",17
Aang,Get out of here! [  Slaps him in the face with an air swipe; continues off screen.  ] You're leaving empty-handed!,17
Qin,Then the destruction of this temple [  Pointing at Aang.  ] will be on your head! [  He leaves through the trap door and Aang airbends it shut.  ],17
Teo,This is bad.,17
Sokka,Very bad!,17
Katara,"Aang, what are we going to do? How can we possibly keep them all away?",17
Aang,I'll tell you how. We have something they don't. [  Points to the sky.  ] Air power. We control the sky. That's something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!,17
Mechanist,I want to help. [  He appears at the door.  ],17
Aang,Good. We'll need it.,17
Mechanist,"We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka. This boy's a genius!",17
Sokka,Thank you. You're a genius!,17
Mechanist,Thank you! [  Katara and Aang exchange unamused glances.  ],17
Sokka,"See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne, [  Places the candle in the model.  ] but once it did, it just kept going. [  He pulls a string connected to the model, putting it on the table.  ] You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?",17
Katara,"Ugh, if only we knew. [  Teo, Katara, and Aang laugh.  ]",17
Sokka,"A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.",17
Katara,"Huh, that's actually pretty smart.",17
Sokka,"Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs: [  He begins listing them off on his fingers.  ] smoke, slime, fire, and ...",17
Mechanist,Stink! Never underestimate the power of stink!,17
Girl,[  Looking over a ledge.  ] They're coming!,17
Teo,Are we ready?,17
Katara,[  Worriedly.  ] Yes. But where's Sokka with the war balloon?,17
Aang,[  Jumping off Appa.  ] We'll have to start without it.,17
Fire Nation soldier,Take them out of the sky. Now!,17
Aang,We've got them on the run! We need more slime!,17
Katara,Those things are unstoppable!,17
Teo,"[  Thoughtfully, trying to remember what he knew.  ] I think I know how they work. I remember my dad tinkering with the counterbalancing system. Something to do with water. Works great, huh?",17
Katara,Water? Can you get me close to one?,17
Teo,No problem!,17
Teo,We're out of bombs!,17
Katara,Come on Sokka. [  Side-view of Katara.  ] Where's that war balloon?,17
Sokka,"Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?",17
Mechanist,The insignia! [  Close-up of Fire Nation insignia.  ] They think we're on their side.,17
Sokka,[  Close-up of Sokka on war balloon.  ] Then I guess they won't see this coming. [  Slices rope attached to a large bomb.  ],17
Mechanist,[  Cut to view of both balloon and advancing army.  ] Bombs away!,17
Sokka,"Oh no, that was the last one. [  Cut to tanks beginning to scale the cliffs.  ]",17
Mechanist,[  Cut back to Sokka and the mechanist.  ] Wait a second. You smell that?,17
Sokka,Rotten eggs! [  Cut to a view of the balloon and a large crevice in the ground below.  ] There! That's were the gas is escaping.,17
Mechanist,What are you doing? That's our fuel source.,17
Sokka,It's the only bomb we've got.,17
Aang,Look! They're retreating! [  Cheers from crowd.  ],17
Sokka,[  War balloon flies past.  ] We're going down!,17
Katara,"[  Cut to Aang and Katara on balcony.  ] No, Sokka! Hold on! [  Aang jumps on his glider and flies toward them.  ]",17
Sokka,"[  Cut to close-up of Sokka swinging his boomerang around with a rope attached, the mechanist behind him.  ] Get ready!",17
Aang,"You know what? [  Cut to close-up panning shot of Sokka, Katara, Aang, Teo, and the mechanist.  ] I'm really glad you guys all live here now. [  Cut to shot above Aang picking up a hermit crab.  ] I realized, it's like the hermit crab. [  Cut to close-up of Aang's hands surrounding the hermit crab.  ] Maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now you protect each other.",17
Teo,"That means a lot, coming from you.",17
Sokka,"[  Cut to Aang, Sokka and Katara.  ] Aang you were right about air power. As long as we've got the skies, we'll have the Fire Nation on the run. [  Cut to wide-view of temple grounds, crowd cheering.  ]",17
Qin,"[  Cut to Qin, surrounded by two other ministers.  ] This defeat is the gateway to many victories.",17
Sokka,"[  Hanging lazily over the back of Appa's saddle; grumpily.  ] I'm not one to complain, [  Side-view shows Appa flying just above the water.  ] but can't Appa fly  any  higher?",18
Aang,"[  Irritably.  ] I have an idea! Why don't we all get on  your  [  Points angrily at Sokka; Katara briefly looks at Aang, but resumes her stare in front of her.  ] back and  you  could fly us to the North Pole?!",18
Sokka,"[  Back-view of Sokka looking over his shoulder; sarcastically.  ] I'd  love  to. [  Points to his back.  ] Climb on everyone, [  Shakes his rear.  ] Sokka's  ready  for take off.",18
Katara,"[  Waving her hands up and down while shifting looks between Aang and Sokka.  ] Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.",18
Sokka,"[  Frontal shot, Momo is now on his lap; annoyed.  ] And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe. [  Cut to a wide side-shot, revealing Appa floating along a vast ocean of only water and ice.  ] There's nothing up here.",18
Katara,They're waterbenders! [  Happily.  ] We found the Water Tribe!,18
Zhao,He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.,18
Li,[  Impatiently.  ] Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get him!,18
Zhao,"Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into. The Water Tribe is a great nation. There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war. The frozen tundra is treacherous, the landscape itself is an icy fortress. We'll need a massive invasion force.",18
Aang,[  Pointing excitedly.  ] There it is!,18
Katara,[  In awe.  ] The Northern Water Tribe.,18
Sokka,[  Surprised.  ] We're finally here.,18
Katara,[  Fascinated.  ] I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!,18
Aang,"[  To Katara.  ] We'll find a master to teach us, no problem.",18
Katara,This place is beautiful.,18
Sokka,Yeah ... she is ...,18
Iroh,"[  Singing.  ] Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Four seasons ... four loves ... Four seasons ... for love.",18
Arnook,"Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe. And they have brought with them, someone very special, someone whom many of us believed disappeared from the world until now ... the Avatar! [  Crowd applauds and cheers.  ] We also celebrate my daughter's sixteenth birthday. Princess Yue is now of marrying age!",18
Yue,"Thank you, Father. May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times!",18
Arnook,"Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!",18
Sokka,"Hi there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.",18
Yue,[  Smiling and bowing slightly.  ] Very nice to meet you. [  They nervously share an awkward silence for a moment.  ],18
Sokka,"[  Nervously.  ] So ... uhhh ... you're a princess, huh? [  She nods and smiles.  ] You know, back in my tribe, I'm kind of like a prince, myself. [  Shot pans left to reveal Katara.  ]",18
Katara,"[  Hopping in on the conversation; teasingly.  ] Ha, prince of what?",18
Sokka,A lot of things! Do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here.,18
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] My apologies,  Prince  Sokka.",18
Sokka,"So, it looks like I'm going to be in town for a while. I'm thinking ... maybe we could ... do an activity, together?",18
Yue,[  Slightly confused; laughs.  ] Do an activity?,18
Katara,Very smooth ...,18
Arnook,"Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar. [  Aang bows.  ]",18
Pakku,"Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment.",18
Aang,My friend and I can't wait to start training with you! After we relax for a couple of days.,18
Pakku,"If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island. If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night.",18
Zuko,"For the last time, I'm not playing the tsungi horn!",18
Iroh,"No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.",18
Zhao,I'm taking your crew.,18
Zuko,[  Cut to a shocked Zuko.  ] What?! [  Turns around to face Zhao.  ],18
Zhao,I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.,18
Zuko,"Uncle, is that true?",18
Iroh,I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone ... [  Putting his arm over his face in woe.  ] even the cook.,18
Zhao,Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar. But I can't have you getting in my way again.,18
Iroh,"[  Cuts to a furious Zuko. Zuko charges at Zhao in anger, but Iroh cuts him off.  ] No!",18
Zhao,"I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.",18
Zuko,I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.,18
Zhao,"Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?",18
Iroh,Just rumors. I don't think he is real.,18
Zhao,"He's real, all right. [  He hands the broad sword to Iroh.  ] He's a criminal, and an enemy of the Fire Nation. But I have a feeling justice will catch up with him soon. [  Zhao moves to exit the cabin.  ] General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands ... if you change your mind.",18
Katara,[  Excitedly.  ] I've waited for this day my whole life. I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!,18
Aang,"Good morning, Master Pakku!",18
Pakku,"[  Drops the water, and speaks in an annoyed tone.  ] No, please, march right in. I'm not concentrating or anything.",18
Aang,"Uhhh ... This is my friend, Katara. The one I told you about?",18
Pakku,"I'm sorry, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You didn't tell me your friend was a girl. In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.",18
Katara,[  Angrily.  ] What do you mean you won't teach me? I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me no!,18
Pakku,No.,18
Katara,But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!,18
Pakku,"Here, the women learn from Yagoda to use their waterbending to heal. I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student, despite your bad attitude.",18
Katara,"I don't want to heal, I want to fight!",18
Pakku,"I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.",18
Katara,"[  Furious.  ] Well, your rules stink!",18
Aang,"[  Also just as angry.  ] Yeah, they're not fair! If you won't teach Katara, then ...",18
Pakku,Then what?,18
Aang,Then I won't learn from you!,18
Pakku,"Well, have fun teaching yourself! I'm sure you'll do a great job.",18
Katara,"Wait! Aang didn't mean that! [  Goes to Aang.  ] You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku, even if he is a big jerk.",18
Pakku,"Why don't we get started, then? [  Aang gets hit with a water blast from him.  ]",18
Sokka,"Princess Yue, good morning! How about that picnic last night? Boy, your dad sure does know how to throw a party.",18
Yue,I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.,18
Sokka,"Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left. [  They both blush.  ] So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.",18
Yue,"Do an activity, you mean?",18
Sokka,Yes ... at a place ... for some time.,18
Yue,[  Laughs.  ] I'd love to. I'll meet you on that bridge tonight. [  Points at a bridge.  ],18
Sokka,Great! I'll see you– Ah! [  Falls into the water.  ],18
Yue,[  Laughs.  ] Sorry.,18
Sokka,"[  Climbs out of the water.  ] That's okay, it was worth it. See you tonight.",18
Zhao,I'm very impressed. You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind.,18
Oh,That's some tasty gold.,18
Pirate captain,What do you need us to do?,18
Zhao,I believe you're acquainted with Prince Zuko.,18
Katara,Uhhh ... Hi. Are you Yagoda?,18
Yagoda,Are you here for the healing lesson?,18
Katara,"[  Looks at all the young girls, and speaks in a disappointed tone.  ] I guess I am.",18
Yagoda,Welcome ... welcome!,18
Pakku,"You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull.",18
Aang,I'm trying ...,18
Pakku,[  Slurps some soup.  ] Maybe that move is too advanced for you. Why don't you try an easier one?,18
Katara,Thanks for the lesson.,18
Yagoda,"So, who's the lucky boy?",18
Katara,Huh?,18
Yagoda,"Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right?",18
Katara,[  Shocked.  ] Ah ... No. I don't think I'm ready for that yet. My grandmother gave my mother this necklace and my mother passed it down to me.,18
Yagoda,I recognize this carving! I don't know why I didn't realize sooner; you're the spitting image of Kanna!,18
Katara,"[  Confused.  ] Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name?",18
Yagoda,"When I was about your age, I was friends with Kanna. She was born here in the Northern Tribe.",18
Katara,She never told me.,18
Yagoda,Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender. He carved that necklace for her.,18
Katara,"If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?",18
Yagoda,I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.,18
Crew member,Good luck!,18
Iroh,[  Cut to a shot of Prince Zuko lying in bed in the foreground of his cabin. The door opens and Iroh sticks his head in. Entering.  ] The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.,18
Zuko,[  Bitterly.  ] Good riddance to those traitors.,18
Iroh,It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head. [  No response.  ] Or just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.,18
Oh,Careful with the blasting jelly!,18
Zuko,"[  Hearing the noise.  ] Uncle? Uncle, is that you? [  Walks around the ship.  ]",18
Iroh,Zuko! [  Runs back to see the ship destroyed.  ] Zuko ...,18
Sokka,"Hi, Princess Yue. I made you something. I carved it myself.",18
Yue,It's a bear.,18
Sokka,"Actually, it's supposed to be a fish. [  Flips the carved creature around.  ] See, it has a fin.",18
Yue,"Oh. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have asked you to come here. [  Runs away.  ]",18
Katara,How's warrior training going? [  Sokka kicks his bag.  ],18
Aang,That bad?,18
Sokka,"No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it, one minute she wants to go out with me, and the next, she's telling me to get lost. [  Changing the topic.  ] So, how's waterbending training?",18
Aang,Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.,18
Sokka,"Why don't you just teach her, Aang?",18
Katara,"[  Excited.  ] Why didn't I think of that? At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learn from Master Pakku! That way, you have someone to practice with, and I get to learn waterbending! Everyone's happy!",18
Sokka,I'm not happy.,18
Katara,"But you're never happy. Come on, Aang.",18
Aang,[  Bending up some water.  ] Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating. [  Sends the water to her.  ],18
Katara,[  Bending the water.  ] I got it!,18
Aang,That was amazing!,18
Katara,That wasn't me.,18
Aang,I was just showing Katara a few moves.,18
Pakku,"You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture.",18
Aang,"I'm sorry, I ...",18
Pakku,You are no longer welcome as my student.,18
Arnook,What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student?,18
Katara,Yes ... please!,18
Arnook,"I suspect he might change his mind, if you swallow your pride and apologize to him.",18
Katara,Fine.,18
Pakku,"I'm waiting, little girl.",18
Katara,No. [  Begins cracking the ice inadvertently.  ] No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you! [  Two pots shatter.  ],18
Aang,Uhhh ... Katara?,18
Katara,I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me.,18
Aang,I'm sure she didn't mean that.,18
Sokka,"Yeah, I think she did.",18
Zhao,I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko. Just ... devastated.,18
Iroh,The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.,18
Zhao,You know who was behind the attack?,18
Iroh,Yes ... pirates. We had a run-in with them a while back. They wanted revenge.,18
Zhao,"[  Sips his tea.  ] So, have you reconsidered my offer?",18
Iroh,"Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation!",18
Zhao,To victory!,18
Sokka,"Are you crazy, Katara? You're not going to win this fight!",18
Katara,[  Takes off her coat.  ] I know! I don't care!,18
Aang,You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.,18
Katara,"I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy! [  Pakku comes down.  ] So, you decided to show up? [  Pakku walks away.  ] Aren't you going to fight?",18
Pakku,"Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong. [  Katara tightens her fist and sends water whips at him. Pakku halts.  ] Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad? Study closely! [  He bends two streams of water from nearby pools and sends them both at a charging Katara, who falls back. He joins the two streams together, encircling both Katara and himself in a forceful ring of water.  ] Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you!",18
Katara,[  Determined.  ] You can't knock me down!,18
Aang,"Go, Katara!",18
Pakku,"Well, I'm impressed. You  are  an excellent waterbender.",18
Katara,"But you still won't teach me, will you?",18
Pakku,No.,18
Pakku,This fight is over.,18
Katara,Come back here. I'm not finished yet!,18
Pakku,"Yes, you are. [  Notices the necklace.  ] This is my necklace ...",18
Katara,"No, it's not. It's mine! Give it back!",18
Pakku,I made this sixty years ago for the love of my life ... for Kanna.,18
Katara,[  Unfreezing the ice; surprised.  ] My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you?,18
Iroh,Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.,18
Zuko,You didn't have to do this.,18
Iroh,No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup.,18
Zuko,"Thank you, Uncle.",18
Iroh,Someone's coming. Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours. Good luck. [  The two head their separate ways.  ],18
Pakku,"I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged. I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her.",18
Katara,"But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage. Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage.",18
Aang,[  To Sokka.  ] Go get her.,18
Yue,What do you want from me?,18
Sokka,"Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.",18
Yue,You don't understand.,18
Sokka,"No, no. See, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a Princess, and I'm ... I'm just a Southern peasant.",18
Yue,"No, Sokka ...",18
Sokka,"It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see you around, okay? [  Yue grabs him and kisses him.  ] Okay, now I'm really confused.  Happy  , but confused.",18
Yue,"I do like you, a lot. But we can't be together, and not for the reason you think. It's because ... I'm engaged. [  She pulls down the collar of her coat and shows him her betrothal necklace.  ] I'm sorry. [  Runs off.  ]",18
Pakku,"Not bad, not bad. [  Laughs.  ] Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age.",18
Aang,"Hey, Katara!",18
Pakku,What do you think you're doing? [  Pause as Katara looks up.  ] It's past sunrise. You're late.,18
Aang,Good to see you here.,18
Katara,"You, too.",18
Zhao,My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.,18
Pakku,"[  Displeased.  ] Nice try, Pupil Sangok. [  Shows Sangok trying to break free.  ] A couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge. [  He unfreezes the ice; Sangok falls to the ground dazed.  ] Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara? [  The scene cuts to several students sitting by the sidelines, the camera panning to the right showing all of them to be tired and unamused.  ] Katara, you've advanced more quickly than any student I've ever trained. [  Cuts to a shot of Katara, who smiles brightly.  ] You have proven that with fierce determination, passion and hard work, you can accomplish anything. [  Turns to Aang irritably.  ] Raw talent alone is not enough. [  Cut to Aang who is lying on the ground with a lazy smile, floating Momo around on an airball above him.  ] Pupil Aang!",19
Aang,"[  Stops bending at the sound of his name; Momo lands on his head.  ] Yes, Master Pakku?",19
Pakku,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Care to step into the sparring circle? I figure since you've found time to play with house pets, you must have already mastered waterbending.",19
Aang,"[  Jumps off the ground with airbending.  ] I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out.",19
Yue,So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe?,19
Sokka,[  Sitting down on the ledge.  ] Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.,19
Yue,"[  Laughs and places her hand on Sokka's shoulder; when Sokka smiles at her, she gets a little upset and looks at him seriously.  ] Sokka, this is wrong.",19
Sokka,[  Protesting.  ] What's wrong? We're taking a walk!,19
Yue,[  Unsurely.  ] I'm engaged. It just feels ...,19
Sokka,"[  Brightens.  ] I know what you need. [  He hops off the rail to stand by her side.  ] You need to meet my good friend, Appa.",19
Yue,[  Curiously.  ] Who?,19
Sokka,"[  Opening his arms out in enthusiasm.  ] Appa and I go way back, don't we, boy? [  The thunder of Appa's shifting bulk is heard and Sokka's features turn to surprise. Appa enters from the left and lands on top of him and licks him, much to Sokka's dismay.  ] Ah, ah, easy! Down boy! Agh! No, up!",19
Yue,Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention!,19
Yue,"[  Excitedly.  ] So, how does this work?",19
Sokka,You holding on tight? [  Yue nods; in a cool tone.  ] Yip ... [  Cut to a close up of Sokka's face.  ] yip.,19
Yue,"[  Impressed.  ] Oh ... my ... goodness! [  Cuts to where Appa is soaring over the ocean; Yue is looking over the saddle.  ] Wow, I can't believe you do this every day.",19
Sokka,"[  Stretches.  ] Yeah, we pretty much live up here.",19
Yue,Is it always this cold in the sky? [  Moves closer to Sokka.  ],19
Sokka,[  Happily.  ] Not when you're with someone.,19
Yue,"[  Turning to face Sokka, blushing.  ] It's beautiful up here.",19
Sokka,"Yeah ... [  The two turn to each other and slowly begin to lean in, but at the very last moment, Sokka widens his eyes, turns away and pretends to act cool again.  ] Woo, yeah! Ahhh, good times, good times. [  Snow and black soot start to fall from the sky.  ] Hey, look!",19
Yue,[  Camera zooms out to Appa flying through the gray snowfall; worried.  ] What's happening?,19
Sokka,[  Nervous.  ] Oh no ...,19
Sokka,[  Picking up handful of black snow.  ] Soot.,19
Yue,What?,19
Sokka,"I've seen this before, right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow. [  Rises.  ]",19
Yue,"But, why?",19
Sokka,"[  Looking out over the horizon.  ] It's the Fire Nation. [  Looks at Yue concerned.  ] They've closed in on the North Pole and from the looks of this stuff, [  Camera zooms out to show the enormity of the sooty snowfall.  ] I'd say there's a lot of them.",19
Zhao,"[  Voice-over.  ] This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh. [  Cuts to Zhao and Iroh standing on deck.  ] Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao, who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You're lucky you're here to see it.",19
Iroh,"[  Tersely.  ] Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.",19
Zhao,"I suppose you speak from experience, but rest assured. This will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se. [  Walks forward.  ]",19
Iroh,"[  Sadly.  ] I hope not, for your sake.",19
Zhao,Tell the captains to prepare for first strike.,19
Iroh,[  Secretly.  ] We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?,19
Zuko,"[  Removes his mask to reveal his face covered in cuts.  ] I'm working on it, Uncle. [  Puts covering back in place.  ]",19
Sokka,[  Trying to drag her along.  ] What's wrong? [  Pointing up to the citadel.  ] We have to go!,19
Yue,"[  Sadly; lets go of Sokka's hand.  ] No, Sokka, wait, I can't see you anymore. Not at all.",19
Sokka,[  Protesting.  ] What? We're just friends.,19
Yue,"I wish we could just be friends, but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you. I'm marrying someone else! [  Turns away sorrowfully.  ]",19
Sokka,"You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.",19
Yue,But I do love my people.,19
Sokka,[  Objecting.  ] You're not marrying  them.,19
Yue,"[  Turns to face Sokka.  ] You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe. I have to do this. Goodbye.",19
Arnook,"The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire Nation is on our doorstep. It is with great sadness I call my family here before me, knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from our tribe, [  While saying this line, the scene flashes from Yue to Pakku to Hahn.  ] but they will never vanish from our hearts. Now, as we approach the battle for our existence, I call upon the great spirits. Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit of the Moon! Be with us! I'm going to need volunteers for a dangerous mission.",19
Sokka,[  Rising from his seat.  ] Count me in!,19
Katara,Sokka ...,19
Arnook,"Be warned, many of you will not return. [  Several Water Tribe men rise and walk forward.  ] Come forward to receive my mark, if you accept the task.",19
Arnook,The stillness before battle is unbearable. Such a quiet dread.,19
Aang,I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people. [  Determined.  ] I'm going to make a difference this time.,19
Aang,Yip-yip!,19
Sokka,[  Pulls his arm free from the snow.  ] Katara!,19
Aang,"I'll take it from here, boy.",19
Aang,[  Brightening.  ] Appa!,19
Aang,"Thanks for the rescue, buddy!",19
Aang,[  Shocked.  ] You've got to be kidding me ...,19
Arnook,"Men, you'll be infiltrating the Fire Nation Navy. That means you'll all need one of these uniforms.",19
Hahn,[  Angrily.  ] What's your problem?,19
Sokka,Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.,19
Hahn,[  Irritably.  ] Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers.,19
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] When, like, a hundred years ago?",19
Arnook,Eighty-five.,19
Sokka,[  Walks over and flings one of the shoulder spikes with his finger.  ] The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined.,19
Hahn,"How do we know we can trust this guy? [  Turns to growl at Sokka, who glares at him in return.  ] Such bold talk for a new recruit.",19
Arnook,"Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn. He's a capable warrior and I value his input. [  Sokka shoots Hahn a smug look; Arnook turns to the rest of the regiment.  ] Now, our first objective is to determine the identity of their commanding officer.",19
Sokka,"His name is Zhao. Middle-aged, [  Tracing imaginary sideburns with his fingers.  ] big sideburns, bigger temper ...",19
Arnook,"Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn. He's leading this mission. Hahn, show Sokka your respect. [  Beginning to walk away.  ] I expect nothing less from my future son-in-law.",19
Sokka,"[  Stares at Hahn, mouth agape; points at him and narrows his eyes.  ] Princess Yue's marrying  you  ?",19
Hahn,"[  Irritated.  ] Yeah, what of it?",19
Sokka,"[  Turns away from Hahn, upset.  ] Nothing. Congratulations.",19
Pakku,[  Pointing to the sky.  ] Stop those fireballs!,19
Iroh,"It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack. [  Cuts to shot of the ship, sailing past a rising moon.  ] The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak. [  Cuts back to Iroh and Zhao.  ]",19
Zhao,"Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution. But for now, daybreak it is.",19
Yue,They've stopped firing.,19
Katara,Aang!,19
Aang,"[  Clearly exhausted, placing his hands on his head.  ] I can't do it ... I can't do it.",19
Katara,What happened?,19
Aang,"[  Dimly.  ] I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.",19
Yue,"[  Pleadingly.  ] But, you have to. You're the Avatar.",19
Aang,[  Solemnly.  ] I'm just one kid.,19
Iroh,"If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.",19
Zuko,"I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle.",19
Iroh,"I'm sorry. I just nag you, because ... well, [  Voice breaking slightly.  ] ever since I lost my son ...",19
Zuko,"Uncle, you don't have to say it.",19
Iroh,... I think of you as my own.,19
Zuko,"[  Faces his uncle, a softer expression on his face.  ] I know, Uncle. We'll meet again. [  Iroh hugs him.  ] After I have the Avatar. [  He turns away and gets on the boat.  ]",19
Iroh,Remember your breath of fire. It could save your life out there.,19
Zuko,"I will. [  Lowers the boat, suspended by ropes, down the side of the ship into the water.  ]",19
Iroh,And put your hood up. Keep your ears warm!,19
Zuko,I'll be fine!,19
Hahn,"[  Smugly.  ] Let me tell you Sokka, I've courted a lot of girls, but Yue is the finest and she comes with the most perks.",19
Sokka,[  Annoyed.  ] Perks? What does  that  mean?,19
Hahn,"I mean, Yue's nice and everything, but the points I'll gain with the chief aren't bad either.",19
Sokka,[  Angered.  ] Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you!,19
Hahn,"[  Camera begins closing up on Hahn.  ] Whoa, hang on. What do  you  care? [  Sokka closes his eyes sorrowfully.  ] You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our life? [  Smirking.  ] No offense.",19
Sokka,"[  Shouts and tackles Hahn; the two begin rolling around on the floor in a struggle.  ] You're just a jerk without a soul, no offense!",19
Arnook,"That's enough! Sokka, you're off the mission!",19
Hahn,"All right, fall in men! Everybody listen to what I say and we'll take out this Admiral Chō in no time!",19
Sokka,"[  Irritated, waves arms in gesture.  ] It's Admiral  Zhao  !",19
Zuko,"[  Peering down into the hole.  ] Where are they going? [  Cuts to a shot of the hole, his face reflected in the water.  ] They're coming up for air somewhere.",19
Yue,"[  Off camera.  ] The legends say the moon was the first waterbender. [  Cuts to shot of her, Katara and Aang standing on a balcony, looking up at the sky.  ] Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves.",19
Katara,I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.,19
Yue,"Our strength comes from the spirit of the moon. Our life comes from the spirit of the ocean. [  Camera pans slightly downward, showing Aang with a dull expression on his face.  ] They work together to keep balance.",19
Aang,"[  Brightening.  ] The spirits! [  Raises head, startling Momo.  ] Maybe I can find them and get their help!",19
Yue,How can you do that?,19
Katara,[  Approaching her.  ] The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World! Aang can talk to them!,19
Yue,[  To Aang.  ] Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle!,19
Aang,"[  Waves arms out in gesture.  ] Or maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation! [  The two girls look at him oddly; Aang looks at them and straightens up.  ] Or wisdom. That's good, too.",19
Katara,"The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident. How are you going to get there this time?",19
Yue,I have an idea. Follow me.,19
Aang,"[  Walking up to the door.  ] So, is this the way to the Spirit World?",19
Yue,[  Laughs.  ] No. You'll have to get there on your own. [  Leans inward.  ] But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole. [  Opens the door.  ],19
Aang,[  Runs to the back of the oasis and rolls around on the ground.  ] I never thought I'd miss grass this much!,19
Katara,[  Approaching the oasis.  ] It's so warm here! How is that possible?,19
Yue,It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land.,19
Aang,"You're right, Yue. I can feel ... something. It's so tranquil. [  Positions himself to meditate.  ]",19
Zuko,[  To the barking turtle seals.  ] Be quiet!,19
Arnook,"Is something wrong, Sokka?",19
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Oh, no. Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine.",19
Arnook,Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons. I have a special task in mind for you.,19
Sokka,"What, you want me to scrub the barracks?",19
Arnook,"I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue.",19
Sokka,[  Rises and tries to act cool.  ] Oh ... Sure. That ... shouldn't be too hard.,19
Yue,Why is he sitting like that?,19
Katara,"He's meditating, trying to cross over into the Spirit World. [  Aang scrunches up his face in concentration.  ] It takes all his concentration.",19
Yue,Is there any way we can help?,19
Aang,"[  Angrily.  ] How about some quiet? Come on guys, I can hear every word you're saying!",19
Yue,[  Worried.  ] Is he okay?,19
Katara,He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body. [  Cuts to overhead shot of the pond.  ] That's his way back to the physical world.,19
Yue,Maybe we should get some help.,19
Katara,"[  Smiling.  ] No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.",19
Zuko,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Well, aren't you a big girl now.",19
Katara,[  Alarmed and dismayed.  ] No ...,19
Zuko,[  Determined.  ] Yes. Hand him over and I won't have to hurt you.,19
Zuko,"[  Rising.  ] I see you've learned a new trick, but I didn't come this far to lose to you.",19
Zuko,"You little peasant. You've found a master, haven't you?",19
Zhao,It's daybreak at last. Let's write history.,19
Zuko,You rise with the moon ... I rise with the sun.,19
Zhao,"The Water Tribe can try to resist the inevitable, but their city will fall today.",19
Katara,Aang!,19
Sokka,What happened? Where's Zuko?,19
Katara,[  Dismayed.  ] He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.,19
Sokka,[  Off-camera.  ] Where did they go ...,19
Katara,[  Off-screen; sorrowfully.  ] I can't believe I lost him.,20
Sokka,"You did everything you could, and now we need to do everything we can to get him back. [  Cuts to shot of Katara who looks up at her brother, tears in her eyes.  ] Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine.",20
Katara,"Okay. [  Closes eyes and gets up. Camera pans over to where Momo remains motionless on the ground. Cuts to shot of Appa, Katara having mounted the bison.  ] It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.",20
Sokka,"Yip, yip.",20
Aang,Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you. I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean Spirits.,20
Baboon spirit,[  Cut to a frontal shot of the baboon spirit.  ] Go. Away. [  Opens one eye. Cut back to the side-shot.  ] You're still here?,20
Aang,"Yes, I need -",20
Baboon spirit,"[  Cut to close-up of the baboon spirit who shuts his eyes tightly. Louder, trying to distract himself.  ] Ohm! [  A firefly flies past; points at the insect.  ] Perhaps that thing will help you. Chase it. [  Aang runs after it. The mystical monkey keeps his eyes shut for a second more before opening one to confirm Aang's departure. He shakes his head and breathes a sigh of relief.  ] Finally.",20
Aang,Come back!,20
Roku,"Hello, Aang.",20
Aang,[  Looking at him; surprised.  ] Roku!,20
Zuko,Shelter. [  Drags Aang into the cave and ties him up.  ],20
Aang,"Roku, the Water Tribe's under attack. I need to find the Ocean and the Moon Spirits.",20
Roku,[  Pops out of the reflection in front of Aang.  ] The Ocean and the Moon are ancient spirits. They crossed over the Spirit World to the mortal world very near the beginning. There is only one spirit I know of who is old enough to remember.,20
Aang,Who?,20
Roku,"The spirit's name is Koh, but he is very dangerous. They call him the Face Stealer. [  Aang looks horrified.  ] When you speak with him, you must be very careful to show no emotion at all. Not the slightest expression, or he will steal your face. [  Aang looks even more horrified but calmly nods, understanding the situation.  ]",20
Zuko,"I finally have you, but I can't get you home because of this blizzard. [  Stands up and looks outside the cave.  ] There's always something. Not that you would understand. You're like my sister. Everything always came easy to her. She's a firebending prodigy, and everyone adores her. My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck, though. I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am.",20
Iroh,"I don't need to remind you we have a time limit. If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable.",20
Zhao,I assure you I have everything under control. I intend to remove the moon as a factor.,20
Iroh,[  Shocked.  ] Remove the moon? How?,20
Hahn,Admiral Choi! Prepare to meet your fate!,20
Zhao,"[  Continuing as if nothing happened.  ] As I was saying, years ago I stumble upon a great and powerful secret: the identity of the Moon Spirit's mortal form.",20
Iroh,What?,20
Zhao,"I was a young lieutenant serving under General Shu in the Earth Kingdom. [  Fade to a flashback of a young Zhao tearing through scrolls in a library.  ] I discovered a hidden library. Underground, in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll. One of them contained a detailed illustration, and the words ""moon"" and ""ocean"". I knew then that these spirits could be found and killed. [  The memory ends with a close up of Zhao's eyes, fade to the present.  ] And that it was my destiny to do so.",20
Iroh,"[  Somewhat angrily.  ] Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!",20
Zhao,"Yes, yes ... I know you fear the spirits, Iroh. I've heard rumors about your journey into the Spirit World. But the Ocean and Moon gave up their immortality to become a part of our world. And now they will face the consequences.",20
Aang,You're just a curly tailed blue nose.,20
Aang,[  Startled.  ] Aaahhh! [  Aang takes a deep breath and speaks with his and Avatar Roku's voices combined.  ] Show no fear. Show no emotion at all.,20
Aang,Hello? I-I'm looking for a spirit named 'Koh'.,20
Koh,"[  Creepily, circling Aang.  ] Welcome!",20
Aang,"[  Emotionlessly.  ] Thank you. [  Koh wheels around Aang to look at him from behind. His voice is low and melodic, almost purring.  ]",20
Koh,"My old friend, the Avatar. It's been a long time.",20
Aang,You know me?,20
Koh,"[  Now facing the camera, away from Aang.  ] How could I forget [  He switches with a ""winking"" effect, as if some sort of nictitating membrane closes briefly over the old face to reveal a new one, to a mad face of a middle-aged, mustached man with thick eyebrows, long mustache, and beard; angrily.  ]  you  ? One of your previous incarnations tried to slay me! Nearly eight or nine hundred years ago.",20
Aang,"[  Confused, yet seriously.  ] I didn't know that. Why did he, or  I  , try to kill you?",20
Koh,"[  Switches to Ummi's scared, sad face.  ] Oh, it was something about stealing the face of someone you loved. [  Cut to a close-up of Aang with the camera slowing, zooming in on his face. Cut back to Koh, whose face turns malicious and switches to a baboon's while laughing. Switch to a side-shot; Aang keeps a straight face while not taking his eyes off Koh as he circles around him.  ] Of course, that's all behind us. Why should I hold a grudge against you for something in a past life? After all, you're a different person now. [  Speaks into Aang's ear from behind.  ] You've come to me ... with a new face.",20
Zuko,Guess we'll be here awhile.,20
Yue,"Don't worry, Prince Zuko can't be getting too far in this weather.",20
Katara,I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.,20
Sokka,"They're not going to die in this blizzard. If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up. They'll survive, and we'll find them.",20
Koh,[  Continues to circle around Aang.  ] It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection. [  His face is now that of an owl.  ] So ... how may I help you?,20
Aang,I need to find the moon and the ocean.,20
Koh,"Their spirit names are Tui and La, push and pull. And that has been the nature of their relationship for all time.",20
Aang,[  Side-view of Aang.  ] Please. Help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help. [  Top-down view of Koh who changes his face to that of an old man. Aang is visible below him.  ],20
Koh,"Oh, you think you need their help. [  Koh looks to the side.  ] Actually it's quite the other way round. [  In an instant, Koh turns and bolts to Aang, stopping just short of the young Avatar; with an angry blue ogre-like face with red eyes and upright fangs.  ]  Someone's going to kill them!  [  Aang closes his eyes briefly before opening them to look at Koh.  ]",20
Aang,What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?,20
Koh,"[  Flipping back to his white face.  ] You've already met them, actually. [  View of Koh from behind Aang as Koh moves to look away, turning his back on Aang.  ] Tui and La, your moon and ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other, push and pull, life and death, [  Close-up of Aang's face.  ] good and evil, yin and yang.",20
Aang,"[  Excitedly.  ] The koi fish! [  Hearing the emotion in Aang's voice, Koh quickly reels around to stare at the now expressionless face of Aang.  ] I must be going now.",20
Koh,"[  Flipping to the face of a bald, young man.  ] We'll meet again.",20
Aang,"The spirits are in trouble, I need to get back to the physical world.",20
Roku,"[  Cut to Roku's image on the ground.  ] A friend is here, to guide you back.",20
Aang,[  Aang turns around; excitedly.  ] Hei Bai!,20
Zhao,"We'll be following this map to a very special location. And when we get there, we're going fishing. [  He smirks.  ]",20
Aang,"This is where I came in, but how do I get back?",20
Baboon spirit,[  Cut to baboon spirit sitting on a rock. Opening his eyes.  ] Good riddance.,20
Aang,"Momo! [  Walking toward Momo. Closer view of Aang with Momo.  ] Momo. Oh no, where's my body?",20
Katara,"Look, that's gotta be Aang! Yip-yip!",20
Zuko,Welcome back.,20
Aang,[  Cut to close-up of Aang as he narrows his eyes.  ] It's good to be back.,20
Zuko,[  Zuko pulls Aang up by his collar as seen from behind Aang.  ] That won't be enough to escape.,20
Aang,[  On seeing Appa.  ] Appa!,20
Zuko,[  Throwing the tied-up Aang aside who yelps.  ] Here for a rematch?,20
Katara,"[  Confidently while countering his fire blasts.  ] Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.",20
Sokka,"Hey, this is some quality rope!",20
Aang,We need to get to the oasis; the spirits are in trouble!,20
Aang,"Wait, we can't just leave him here.",20
Sokka,Sure we can. Let's go.,20
Aang,"No, if we leave him he'll die.",20
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us.",20
Sokka,[  Yue grabs her head as if in pain.  ] Are you okay?,20
Yue,I feel faint.,20
Aang,"[  Cut to Aang. Holding his head with one hand.  ] I feel it, too. The Moon Spirit is in trouble.",20
Yue,[  Cut back to the saddle.  ] I owe the Moon Spirit my life.,20
Sokka,What do you mean?,20
Yue,"[  Close-up of Yue.  ] When I was born I was very sick and very weak. [  Flashback to Yue as a baby.  ] Most babies cry when they're born, but I was born as if I was asleep, my eyes closed. [  Cut to waterbenders attempting to heal Yue as a baby.  ] Our healers did everything they could. [  Panning shot of Yue and the waterbenders, along with Yue's parents.  ] They told my mother and father I was going to die. [  Cut to Arnook staring at the moon.  ] My father pleaded with the spirits to save me. [  Cut to shot panning down from the moon to the oasis.  ] That night, beneath the full moon, he brought me to the oasis and placed me in the pond. [  Cut to Yue being placed into the pond.  ] My dark hair turned white. [  Close-up of Yue in the oasis.  ] I opened my eyes and began to cry, and they knew I would live. [  Cut to Yue in her parents arms with the archway and moon behind them.  ] That's why my mother named me Yue. [  Cut back to Appa's saddle.  ] For the moon.",20
Zhao,"[  Cut to Zhao at the oasis.  ] I am ... a legend, now! [  Cut to panning shot from Zhao's hand, grasping the bag with Tui in it, down to his head.  ] The Fire Nation will, for generations, tell stories about the great Zhao, who darkened the moon. They will call me, Zhao the Conqueror, Zhao the Moon Slayer, Zhao the Invincible! [  Momo jumps on top of Zhao's head.  ] Ugh ... Get it off! Get it off!",20
Zhao,Don't bother. [  Close-up of Zhao as he lifts the sack up threatening to kill Tui.  ],20
Aang,"[  Cut to Aang and the others surrendering.  ] Zhao, don't!",20
Zhao,"[  Cut to panning side-view.  ] It's my destiny, to destroy the moon and the Water Tribe.",20
Aang,"[  Close-up side-view of Aang.  ] Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe. [  Close-up panning shot of the sack with Tui inside and Zhao.  ] It will hurt everyone, including you. [  Cut to panning shot of the oasis.  ] Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world. [  Cut to Zhao.  ]",20
Iroh,[  Off-screen.  ] He is right Zhao.,20
Zhao,"[  Cut to wide shot of oasis; calmly to Iroh.  ] General Iroh, why am I not surprised to discover your treachery?",20
Iroh,"[  Close-up of Iroh while he takes off his hood.  ] I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon, too; we all depend on the balance. Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold. Let it go, now!",20
Yue,"[  Close-up of Yue and Sokka.  ] There's no hope now, it's over.",20
Aang,"[  Close-up of Aang entering the Avatar State.  ] No, it's not over.",20
Zhao,You're alive?,20
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] You tried to have me killed! [  Zuko attacks Zhao.  ],20
Zhao,"[  Close-up of Zhao's face.  ] Yes I did. [  Zuko approaches Zhao as we see the giant energy form make its way toward the ocean.  ] You're the Blue Spirit, an enemy of the Fire Nation! You freed the Avatar.",20
Zuko,"I had no choice. [  Zuko continues his attacks, but they are blocked by Zhao.  ]",20
Zhao,"You should have chosen to accept your failure; you're a disgrace. Then, at least, you could have lived! [  Zuko and Zhao begin to fight.  ]",20
Katara,"It's too late, it's dead.",20
Iroh,[  Iroh notices Yue.  ] You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. [  Close-up of Yue.  ] Some of its life is in you.,20
Yue,"Yes, you're right. It gave me life, maybe I can give it back.",20
Sokka,No! You don't have to do that. [  Sokka reached to stop her.  ],20
Yue,"It's my duty, Sokka.",20
Sokka,I won't let you! [  Close-up of him holding her hand.  ] Your father told me to protect you.,20
Yue,[  Close-up of Yue.  ] I have to do this.,20
Sokka,"[  Yue falls as Sokka catches her.  ] No! She's gone, she's gone.",20
Yue,"Goodbye, Sokka. [  Close-up of Sokka and Yue as she comes to kiss him.  ] I'll always be with you.",20
Zhao,[  Shot of the moon over Zhao's shoulder.  ] It can't be!,20
Zuko,Take my hand!,20
Pakku,I've decide to go to the South Pole. Some other benders and healers want to join me. It's time we helped rebuild our sister tribe.,20
Katara,What about Aang? He still needs to learn waterbending.,20
Pakku,"Well, then he better get used to calling you  Master  Katara.",20
Arnook,"The spirits gave me a vision when Yue was born. I saw a beautiful, brave, young woman become the Moon Spirit. [  Sighs.  ] I knew this day would come.",20
Sokka,You must be proud.,20
Arnook,So proud ... and sad.,20
Iroh,"I'm surprised Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.",20
Zuko,I'm tired.,20
Iroh,Then you should rest. A man needs his rest.,20
Katara,"You too, Momo.",20
Aang,Come here.,20
Ozai,"Iroh is a traitor, and your brother Zuko is a failure. I have a task for you.",20
Katara,[  Confused.  ] Aang ...,21
Katara,Do you want to talk about it?,21
Aang,"Nah, just a nightmare. I was in the Avatar State, but I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary. [  Closes eyes and bows his head; Katara puts her hand on his shoulder.  ]",21
Pakku,"[  Holds up flask.  ] Katara, I want you to have this. [  Closes up on flask.  ] This amulet contains water from the Spirit Oasis. The water has unique properties. Don't lose it.",21
Katara,"[  Accepts amulet and hugs Pakku.  ] Thank you, Master Pakku.",21
Pakku,"[  Hands Aang box of scrolls.  ] Aang, these scrolls will help you master waterbending. But remember, they're no substitute for a real master. [  Aang looks up at Katara, who is sitting on Appa and looks back.  ] Sokka ... [  Pats him on shoulder, leaving him dismayed.  ] take care, son. [  To the entire gang while pointing out in a direction.  ] Fly straight to the Earth Kingdom base to the east of here. General Fong will provide you with an escort to Omashu. There, you will be safe to begin your earthbending training with King Bumi.",21
Aang,"Appa, yip yip!",21
Katara,[  As they fly away.  ] Say hi to Gran-Gran for me!,21
Iroh,"This is what I've been missing. Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water, and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense? [  Looks at the clearly unhappy Zuko, walks over to him, and sits down on the ground.  ] I see. It's the anniversary, isn't it?",21
Zuko,"[  In a brooding tone.  ] Three years ago today, I was banished. I lost it all. [  Looks up.  ] I want it back. I want the Avatar, I want my honor, my throne. I want my father not to think I'm worthless. [  Looks on regretfully.  ]",21
Iroh,"I'm sure he doesn't. Why would he banish you if he didn't care? [  Zuko gets up and walks away; he grimaces soon after; to the massagers.  ] Uh, that came out wrong, didn't it? [  They look at each other in confusion.  ]",21
Azula,"[  Stepping out of the carriage and walking down the line of soldiers.  ] My brother and my uncle have disgraced the Fire Lord, and have brought shame on all of us. You might have mixed feelings about attacking members of the Royal Family. I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed.",21
Captain,"Princess, I'm afraid the tides will not allow us to bring the ship into port before nightfall.",21
Azula,"I'm sorry, captain, but I do not know much about the tides. Could you explain something to me?",21
Captain,"Of course, Your Highness.",21
Azula,Do the tides command this ship?,21
Captain,I'm afraid I don't understand.,21
Azula,You said the tides would not allow us to bring the ship in. [  In a sharper tone.  ] Do the tides command this ship?,21
Captain,"No, princess.",21
Azula,"And if I were to have you thrown overboard, would the tides think twice about smashing you against the rocky shore?",21
Captain,"[  Worried.  ] No, princess.",21
Azula,"[  Runs fingers through her bangs.  ] Well then, maybe you should worry less about the tides who have already made up their mind about killing you, and worry more about me, who's still mulling it over. [  Turns to face the captain angrily.  ]",21
Captain,I'll pull us in.,21
Sokka,[  Rises to view their destination.  ] There it is!,21
Fong,"Welcome, Avatar Aang! [  Cuts to shot of the team stretching after riding on Appa.  ] I am General Fong, and welcome, to all of you great heroes! Appa, Momo, brave Sokka, the mighty Katara ...",21
Katara,[  Pleased.  ] Mighty Katara? I like that.,21
Sokka,"[  Viewing the display.  ] Not bad, not bad.",21
Fong,"[  Camera view depicts entire room.  ] Avatar Aang, we were all amazed at the stories of how you singlehandedly wiped out an entire Fire Navy fleet at the North Pole. [  Closes up to Fong, stroking his beard.  ] I can't imagine what it feels like to wield such devastating power. It's an awesome responsibility.",21
Aang,[  Casually.  ] I try not to think about it too much.,21
Fong,"[  Calmly.  ] Avatar, you're ready to face the Fire Lord now.",21
Aang,[  Shocked.  ] What? No I'm not!,21
Katara,[  Holds out her hand in reasoning.  ] Aang still needs to master all four elements.,21
Fong,"Why? With the kind of power he possesses, power enough to destroy hundreds of battle ships in a matter of minutes, he could defeat the Fire Lord now!",21
Sokka,"But sir, the thing is, Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar State.",21
Aang,"See, it's this special state where-",21
Fong,"[  Sharply.  ] I'm well aware! Your eyes and tattoos glow and you're able to summon unbelievable power. Without you, we'd be slaughtered before we even reach their shores. [  Looks at map and guides finger from the location of the base to the location of the Fire Nation Capital.  ] But with you leading the way, as the ultimate weapon, we could cut a swath right through to the heart of the Fire Nation.",21
Aang,"[  Doubtfully.  ] Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there.",21
Fong,"So, it's decided then. I'll help you figure out how to get into the Avatar State and then you'll face your destiny.",21
Katara,"[  The group rises; angrily.  ] No, nothing's decided. We already have a plan. Aang's pursuing his destiny  his  way.",21
Fong,"Well, while you take your time learning the elements, the War goes on. May I show you something? [  Leads Aang to a window.  ] That's the infirmary, and those soldiers are the lucky ones. [  Several soldiers are injured and walking slowly.  ] They came back. Every day, the Fire Nation takes lives. People are  dying  , Aang! You could end it,  now  . Think about it.",21
Lo,Almost perfect.,21
Li,One hair out of place.,21
Azula,[  Close-up of her face as she pushes a loose strand of hair away.  ] Almost isn't good enough!,21
Aang,General Fong?,21
Fong,"Come in, Aang. Have you thought about our discussion?",21
Aang,I'm in. I'll fight the Fire Lord.,21
Aang,"[  Sits on his bed.  ] I told the general I'd help him, by going into the Avatar State.",21
Katara,"[  Sits up.  ] Aang, no! This is not the right way!",21
Sokka,[  Resting on his bed with his arms behind his head.  ] Why not? Remember when he took out the Fire Navy? [  Widens his eyes.  ] He was incredible!,21
Katara,"There's a right way to do this. Practice, study, and discipline!",21
Sokka,[  Casually.  ] Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord!,21
Katara,"[  Rises and throws her hands up in surrender.  ] If you two meat heads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine, go ahead and glow it up! [  Exits.  ]",21
Aang,"Katara, I'm just being realistic! I don't have time to do this the right way!",21
Soldier,"[  Drops white food item into the teapot.  ] This rare chi-enhancing tea is a natural stimulant. In an ordinary warrior, it improves strength and energy ten-fold. In you, it may induce the Avatar State.",21
Aang,"Ten-fold energy, huh?",21
Aang,[  Quickly in a high-pitched voice.  ] Is it working? Is it working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar State 'cause I don't have a good view of myself! Am I talking too loud?,21
Sokka,"[  Sitting on the floor, tired out by Aang's actions.  ] I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death.",21
Sokka,Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar State.,21
Aang,I love surprises!,21
Aang,[  Holding up hands.  ] Still not glowing.,21
Oracle,"You are wearing a ceremonial piece of clothing from each of the bending nations. Now I will join the four elements into one! Water [  Pours jug of water into the bowl.  ], earth [  Pours in bowl of dirt.  ], fire [  Takes nearby torch and throws it in.  ], air! [  Releases air gust from wooden contraption.  ] Four elements together as one!",21
Aang,[  Annoyed.  ] This is just mud!,21
Oracle,[  Quizzically.  ] So ... do you feel anything?,21
Fong,[  Rubs mud from face.  ] We have to find a way.,21
Iroh,[  Holds up one shell.  ] Look at these magnificent shells! [  Picks up a conch.  ] I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.,21
Zuko,"We don't need any more useless things! You forget, we have to carry everything ourselves now!",21
Azula,"[  From the corner, sitting at the table; calmly.  ] Hello, brother. Uncle.",21
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] What are you doing here?,21
Azula,"[  Holds up a shell in her hand.  ] In my country, we exchange a pleasant hello before asking questions. [  Rises and walks toward Zuko and Iroh.  ] Have you become uncivilized so soon, Zuzu?",21
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] Don't call me that!,21
Iroh,[  Clearly upset.  ] To what do we owe this honor?,21
Azula,"Hmmm ... must be a family trait. Both of you so quick to get to the point. [  Breaks the shell she was holding with her fingertips, leaving Iroh angry.  ] I've come with a message from home. Father's changed his mind. Family is suddenly very important to him. He's heard rumors of plans to overthrow him; treacherous plots. Family are the only ones you can really trust. [  Pauses briefly.  ] Father regrets your banishment. He wants you home. [  Silence.  ] Did you hear me? You should be happy. Excited. Grateful. I just gave you great news.",21
Iroh,I'm sure your brother simply needs a moment.,21
Azula,"[  Furiously.  ] Don't interrupt, Uncle! [  To Zuko.  ] I still haven't heard my thank you. [  Annoyed.  ] I'm  not  a messenger. I didn't have to come all this way.",21
Zuko,[  Surprised.  ] Father regrets? He ... wants me back?,21
Azula,I can see you need time to take this in. I'll come to call on you tomorrow. Good evening.,21
Katara,Can we talk about something?,21
Aang,Sure.,21
Katara,"[  Cuts to side-shot of Aang and Katara.  ] Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton? It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you. I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore. [  Closes up to Katara.  ] I'm not saying the Avatar State doesn't have incredible and helpful power ... but you have to understand ... for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary.",21
Aang,I'm really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this.,21
Katara,[  Upset.  ] I don't understand.,21
Aang,"[  Cuts to overall view of Aang and Katara.  ] No, you don't. Every day, more and more people die. I'm already one hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it!",21
Katara,[  Sadly.  ] I can't watch you do this to yourself. I'm not coming tomorrow. [  Begins to exit.  ] Good night.,21
Aang,[  Sadly.  ] Good night.,21
Zuko,"[  Packing belongings.  ] We're going home! After three long years, it's unbelievable!",21
Iroh,[  Staring out the window thoughtfully.  ] It  is  unbelievable. I have never known my brother to regret anything.,21
Zuko,Did you listen to Azula? Father's realized how important family is to him! [  Irritated.  ] He cares about me!,21
Iroh,"[  Turns to face Zuko and holds out arms in gesture.  ] I care about you! And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine.",21
Zuko,[  Turns his back to Iroh.  ] You don't know how my father feels about me. You don't know anything!,21
Iroh,"Zuko, I only meant that in our family, things are not always what they seem.",21
Zuko,"[  Turns to face Iroh.  ] I think you are exactly what you seem! A lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man who's always been jealous of his brother!",21
Aang,"[  Sits up in his bed.  ] Sokka! Sokka, wake up.",21
Sokka,Huh?,21
Aang,I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar State.,21
Sokka,You sure?,21
Aang,Yes.,21
Sokka,[  Nonchalantly.  ] Okay.,21
Aang,Do you think the general will be mad?,21
Sokka,What can he say? You're the Avatar. Who knows better than you?,21
Iroh,[  Holding up his hand in motion and running down the staircase after Zuko.  ] Wait! Don't leave without me!,21
Zuko,"[  Turns around, smiles and sets down pack.  ] Uncle! You've changed your mind!",21
Iroh,"Family sticks together, right? [  Lays hand on Zuko's shoulder.  ]",21
Zuko,We're finally going home!,21
Aang,"[  Humbly.  ] The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose. So I guess that's it.",21
Fong,[  Calmly.  ] You sure I can't change your mind?,21
Aang,I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar State when I'm in genuine danger.,21
Fong,I see. I was afraid you'd say that.,21
Sokka,"Aang! [  Attempts to come to his aid, only to be held down by two soldiers.  ]",21
Fong,[  Walks over toward the hole that was created from the impact and points to Aang.  ] Men! Attack the Avatar!,21
Aang,[  Alarmed.  ] What are you doing?,21
Fong,[  Slyly.  ] I believe we're about to get results.,21
Aang,[  Looking about cautiously.  ] I'm not your enemy! I won't fight you!,21
Fong,You can't run forever!,21
Aang,You can't fight forever!,21
Azula,Brother! Uncle! Welcome! I'm so glad you decided to come.,21
Captain,"Are we ready to depart, Your Highness?",21
Azula,"[  Sweetly.  ] Set our course for home, captain.",21
Zuko,[  Wistfully.  ] Home.,21
Captain,[  He walks up the ramp with Zuko and Iroh following him and raises his hand in gesture.  ] You heard the princess! Raise the anchors! We're taking the prisoners home!,21
Captain,"[  Nervously.  ] Your Highness, I ...",21
Zuko,"You lied to me! [  Cut to Azula, who appears confident.  ]",21
Azula,[  Smugly.  ] Like I've never done that before.,21
Katara,"I wonder what crazy thing they're trying to do now. [  Momo, who is sleeping on a pillow, raises his head before going back to sleep. Katara hears another rumble outside and grows worried.  ] Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay.",21
Katara,[  Frantically.  ] What's going on?,21
Sokka,The general's gone crazy! He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar State!,21
Sokka,[  Approaching the ostrich horse carefully.  ] Good ... bird ... horse thingy ...,21
Fong,"[  Looking back at Aang, who has managed to escape up a stairway.  ] Maybe you can avoid me ... but she can't.",21
Katara,[  Struggling to break free.  ] I can't move!,21
Aang,[  Worried; clenches his fists.  ] Don't hurt her!,21
Sokka,[  Riding the ostrich horse.  ] Katara! No!,21
Aang,[  Desperately and clutching onto Fong's arm.  ] Stop this! You have to let her go!,21
Fong,You could save her if you were in the Avatar State!,21
Aang,[  Tears forming around his eyes.  ] I'm trying ... I'm trying!,21
Katara,"[  Frantically.  ] Aang, I'm sinking! [  Twists around again and is buried chest deep.  ]",21
Fong,[  Demanding.  ] I don't see glowing! [  Lowers his right arm and begins closing his hand into a fist; Katara becomes buried neck deep.  ],21
Katara,[  Desperately.  ] Please!,21
Aang,"[  Falling to his knees, begging.  ] You don't need to do this!",21
Fong,"[  Scornfully.  ] Apparently, I do.",21
Fong,[  Triumphantly.  ] It worked! It worked!,21
Iroh,[  Pushes several guards away; grabs one and wrestles him.  ] Zuko! Let's go!,21
Azula,"You know, Father blames Uncle for the loss of the North Pole. And he considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar! [  Cuts to Zuko, who is panting heavily.  ] Why would he want  you  back home, except to lock you up [  Cuts back to Azula.  ] where you can no longer embarrass him?",21
Fong,"[  Pleading.  ] Avatar Aang! Can you hear me? Your friend is safe! [  Brings Katara back above ground; cuts to close-up of her as she looks up at Aang in misery.  ] It was just a trick to trigger the Avatar State ... [  Cuts back to Fong, who smiles maniacally.  ] and it worked!",21
Roku,[  Looking at Aang.  ] It's time you learned.,21
Roku,"[  Cuts to Roku.  ] The Avatar State is a defense mechanism, designed to empower you with the skills and knowledge of all the past Avatars.",21
Roku,"The glow is the combination of all your past lives, focusing their energy through your body.",21
Roku,"In the Avatar State, you are at your most powerful, [  Cuts to Avatar Szeto, who summons lava spouts from four volcanoes; the lava washes over the screen and the scene cuts back to Roku and Aang.  ] but you are also at your most vulnerable.",21
Aang,What do you mean?,21
Roku,"If you are killed in the Avatar State, [  The figures of him and the Avatars in the background are blown away like dust.  ] the reincarnation cycle will be broken [  Shows the line of Avatars with Aang standing at the end; the Avatars begin to fade away in succession down the line.  ] and the Avatar will cease to exist.",21
Aang,"[  Embracing her; regretfully.  ] I'm sorry, Katara. I hope you never have to see me like that again.",21
Fong,[  Triumphantly.  ] Ha! Are you joking? That was almost perfect! [  Thoughtfully.  ] We just have to find out a way to control you when you're like that.,21
Aang,[  Slightly angry.  ] You're out of your mind.,21
Fong,I guess we'll figure it out on the way to the Fire Nation.,21
Sokka,Anybody got a problem with that?,21
Soldier,Do you still want an escort to Omashu?,21
Katara,[  Casts the group a look of annoyance.  ] I think we're all set.,21
Azula,"[  Holds up wanted poster of her brother and uncle.  ] Anyone who harbors these traitors will face the wrath of the Fire Lord! [  She lays a hand on the balcony, causing the two massagers to cower in fear; cuts to close-up of her.  ] There will be no place left to hide!",21
Iroh,I think we're safe here.,21
Sokka,"[  With his hair covering his eyes.  ] You guys are going to be done soon, right? We have a lot of ground to cover if we're going to make it to Omashu today.",22
Katara,"[  Rises from her hunched-over position; turns to face Sokka smugly.  ] What? Like you're ready to go right now, naked guy? [  Smiles at him smugly.  ]",22
Sokka,"I could be ready in two minutes. Seriously, [  Pulls back the hair covering his eyes.  ] whenever.",22
Aang,So you were showing me the octopus form?,22
Katara,"[  Turns her attention back to Aang.  ] Right, let me see your stance.",22
Katara,"[  Walks under his right arm.  ] Your arms are too far apart. [  Positions his arms closer together.  ] See, if you move them closer together, you protect your center. You got it?",22
Aang,"[  Blushing.  ] Oh, yea ... thanks.",22
Katara,"[  Walks away and assumes a fighting stance.  ] Okay, let's see what you got.",22
Katara,"[  Proudly.  ] You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.",22
Chong,"[  Singing.  ] Da, da, da. Don't fall in love with the traveling girl. She'll leave you broke and brokenhearted. [  Cuts to shot of the team standing in the lake. Sokka unexpectedly falls off his leaf into the water. Cuts to nomads. Chong stops singing and points at the group.  ] Hey, river people!",22
Katara,We're not river people.,22
Chong,[  Puzzled.  ] You're not? Well then what kind of people are you?,22
Aang,Just ... people.,22
Chong,"Aren't we all, brother?",22
Sokka,[  Walks over and says accusingly.  ] Who are you?,22
Chong,"I'm Chong and this is my wife, Lily. We're nomads, happy to go wherever the wind takes us! [  He suddenly strums his lute-like instrument in a crazy fashion much like a rock star strums crazily on their guitar.  ]",22
Aang,"[  Starts out with a somewhat puzzled tone, but changes it to an excited one.  ] You guys are nomads? That's great! I'm a nomad!",22
Chong,"[  Just as excitedly.  ] Hey, me too!",22
Aang,[  Blankly.  ] I know ... you just said that.,22
Chong,Oh. [  Noticing Sokka.  ] Nice underwear ...,22
Zuko,"[  Emerging from the bushes, now sporting short, black hair.  ] I didn't find anything to eat! I can't live like this! I wasn't meant to be a fugitive. [  Raises fists in the air and yells at the sky.  ] This is impossible! [  Looking over at Iroh.  ] Uncle, what are you doing?",22
Iroh,"[  Cuts to Iroh who dotes over the flower. Zuko appears behind him.  ] You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it's heartbreaking. That, or it's the white jade, which is poisonous.",22
Zuko,"We need food, not tea. I'm going fishing. [  Walks away.  ]",22
Iroh,[  Dreamily.  ] Hmm ... delectable tea? [  More suspiciously.  ] Or deadly poison?,22
Aang,"[  Wearing a wreath of pink flowers on his head.  ] Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere!",22
Chong,"[  Stops playing.  ] Well not everywhere, Little Arrowhead. But where we haven't been, we've heard about through stories and songs.",22
Aang,They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler!,22
Moku,"[  Lying on the ground; in a dreamy voice.  ] On the way, there's a waterfall that creates a never-ending rainbow!",22
Sokka,"Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up to me.",22
Sokka,"We need to get to Omashu. No sidetracks, no worms and definitely no rainbows.",22
Chong,"Wow, sounds like someone has a case of destination fever. You're worried too much about where you're going.",22
Lily,"You got to focus less on the ""where"" and more on the ""going"". [  She makes gestures with her hand, accidentally tugging on Katara's braid.  ]",22
Sokka,[  Impatiently.  ] O. Ma. Shu!,22
Katara,"Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi, so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.",22
Chong,Sounds like you're headed to Omashu.,22
Chong,There's an old story about a secret pass right through the mountains.,22
Katara,Is this real or a legend?,22
Chong,"Oh, it's a real legend. And it's as old as earthbending itself. [  Begins strumming his lute and singing.  ] Two lovers, forbidden from one another, the war divides their people and the mountain divides them apart! Built a path to be together! [  Stops playing.  ] Yeah, I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes ... [  Resumes singing.  ] Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountains, secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!",22
Sokka,[  Unamused while folding his arms.  ] I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine.,22
Aang,"Yeah, thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground. [  Flashing a smile.  ] And we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable ...",22
Commander,[  Pointing at the trio on Appa.  ] Launch!,22
Team Avatar,Ahhhh!,22
Sokka,"[  Pointing forward.  ] Secret love cave, let's go.",22
Iroh,"Zuko, [  Cut to a wide, overhead shot of Zuko standing behind Iroh.  ] remember that plant I thought might be tea?",22
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ] You didn't ...,22
Iroh,I did ... [  Turns around.  ] and it wasn't. [  Reveals himself to be swollen and covered in red marks.  ],22
Zuko,[  Cut back to Zuko who drops the branch out of shock.  ] Ahh!,22
Iroh,"[  Surprisingly calmly.  ] When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing. [  Excitedly.  ] But look what I found. [  Iroh holds out his arm to reveal berries.  ] These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade. [  Unenthusiastically.  ] That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness.",22
Zuko,[  Grabbing branch of berries and hurling it into the bushes.  ] We're not taking any more chances with these plants! We need to get help.,22
Iroh,But where are we going to go? [  Kneeling down and scratching his rash vigorously.  ] We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom and fugitives from the Fire Nation. [  Camera zooms in on his reddened leg.  ],22
Zuko,"If the Earth Kingdom discovers us, they'll have us killed.",22
Iroh,"[  Rises.  ] But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula.",22
Zuko,[  Nodding and walking away with Iroh.  ] Earth Kingdom it is.,22
Sokka,How far are we from the tunnel?,22
Chong,"Actually, it's not just one tunnel. The lovers didn't want anyone to find out about their love, so they built a whole labyrinth!",22
Sokka,[  Halts in his tracks; in shock.  ] Labyrinth?,22
Chong,"[  Casually.  ] Oh, I'm sure we'll figure it out.",22
Lily,All you need to do is trust in love ... according to the curse.,22
Sokka,[  In a somewhat whining voice.  ] Curse!,22
Chong,Hey-hey! We're here!,22
Sokka,[  Cuts to shot of inscription on the side of the cave entrance.  ] What exactly is this curse?,22
Chong,"The curse says that only those who trust in love can make it through the caves. Otherwise, you'll be trapped in them forever.",22
Lily,And die.,22
Chong,"Oh yeah, and die. [  Brightening.  ] Hey, I just remembered the rest of that song! [  Stands before the entrance and strums lute, while singing an ominous line in a low voice.  ] And die!",22
Sokka,That's it! There's no way we're going through some cursed hole!,22
Moku,"[  Turns head to observe gray smoke rising from the horizon, which he proceeds to point at.  ] Hey, someone's making a big campfire!",22
Katara,"[  In a serious tone.  ] That's no campfire, Moku.",22
Sokka,[  Grimly.  ] It's Fire Nation. They're tracking us.,22
Aang,[  Making sure he understands.  ] So all you need to do is trust in love to get through these caves?,22
Chong,"That is correct, Master Arrowhead.",22
Aang,[  Smiling.  ] We can make it.,22
Sokka,[  Gesturing to the cave; somewhat commanding.  ] Everyone into the hole!,22
Commander,Hold on! It's too dangerous. Haven't you heard the song? Just close them in. The mountain will take care of the rest.,22
Katara,"It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. I hope.",22
Sokka,"We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last?",22
Chong,"[  Casually.  ] Uh, about two hours each.",22
Lily,"[  Lighting the rest of the torches in her hand.  ] And we have five torches, so that's ten hours!",22
Sokka,[  Grabbing torches and stomping out the fire.  ] It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!,22
Lily,"Oh, right.",22
Sokka,I'm going to make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through.,22
Song,"[  Wringing cloth.  ] You two must not be from around here. We know better than to touch the White Jade, much less make it into tea and drink it. [  Flicks Iroh's hand away when he scratches his rash.  ]",22
Iroh,"[  The girl moves away from the camera's eye, revealing Iroh to be in an even worse condition than before with the rash having spread to his face and his cheeks swollen.  ] Whoops!",22
Song,So where are you traveling from?,22
Zuko,"[  Nervously; rises from his seat as she moves his hand down so she could wash it.  ] Yes, we're travelers.",22
Song,Do you have names?,22
Zuko,"Names? Of course we have names. [  Song turns to see Iroh scratching and glares at him, before slapping his hand away.  ] I'm, uh ... Lee and this is my Uncle, uh ... Mushi?",22
Iroh,"[  Shoots him angry look. Cuts to shot of Song taking a lotion from a jar. She begins slathering it over the inflamed areas.  ] Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior. [  Leans over to the side to give Zuko a pleased smile.  ]",22
Song,"Mushi and Junior, huh. My name is Song. You two look like you could use a good meal. [  Slaps Iroh's hand away when he goes to scratch his rash.  ] Why don't you stay for dinner?",22
Zuko,"[  Looking away.  ] Sorry, but we need to be moving on.",22
Song,[  Screwing the cap back on the lid.  ] That's too bad. [  Gives an innocent smile.  ] My mom always makes too much roast duck.,22
Iroh,[  Excitedly.  ] Where do you live exactly?,22
Katara,"Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.",22
Sokka,This doesn't make sense. We already came through this way.,22
Chong,We don't need a map. [  Sokka passes by him.  ] We just need love. The little guy knows it.,22
Aang,"Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map also.",22
Sokka,[  Cuts to an overhead shot of the group standing in the dark cave before switching to Sokka who looks up from the map.  ] There's something strange here. There's only one explanation. [  Cuts to shot of the rest of the group before switching to Sokka who turns to face the camera.  ] The tunnels are changing.,22
Song's mother,[  Setting down a platter of roast duck and taking a seat.  ] My daughter tells me you're refugees. We were once refugees ourselves.,22
Song,"[  Sadly.  ] When I was a little girl, the Fire Nation raided our farming village. All the men were taken away. That was the last time I saw my father.",22
Zuko,[  Close-up of the prince.  ] I haven't seen my father in many years.,22
Song,"[  Sorrowfully.  ] Oh, is he fighting in the War?",22
Zuko,[  Sets down dish.  ] Yeah. [  Looks away in dismay.  ],22
Chong,"[  Frantically.  ] The tunnels, they're a-changin'. It must be the curse! I knew we shouldn't have come down here!",22
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Right, if only we listened to you.",22
Katara,[  Hold up a hand in warning.  ] Everyone be quiet. Listen.,22
Chong,It's a giant flying thing with teeth!,22
Moku,[  The creature lands. Off-camera.  ] No! It's a wolfbat!,22
Chong,"Yeah, it's no use. We're separated. But at least you have us!",22
Sokka,[  Horrified.  ] Nooooo!,22
Song,Can I join you? I know what you've been through. We've all been through it. [  Witnessing Zuko's scar.  ] The Fire Nation has hurt you.,22
Song,"[  Compassionately.  ] It's okay. They've hurt me, too. [  Pulls up pants leg to reveal burn scars on her leg.  ]",22
Chong,"[  Singing as he and the nomads pass the angry warrior.  ] Oh, don't let the cave-in get you down! [  Cuts to shot of him.  ] Don't let the falling rocks turn your smile into a frown! [  He goes off-screen and Moku passes by, nudging Sokka.  ] When the tunnels are darkest, that's when you need a clown, hey! [  Re-enters.  ] Don't let the cave-in get you down, Sokka!",22
Katara,"[  Cheerfully.  ] Aang, look!",22
Aang,[  Running up to a solid rock door.  ] We found the exit!,22
Katara,This isn't the exit.,22
Aang,[  Walking to her side.  ] No. It's a tomb.,22
Aang,It must be the two lovers from the legend; that's who's buried here.,22
Katara,These pictures tell their story.,22
Katara,[  Voice-over.  ] They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages ...,22
Katara,"[  Voice-over.  ] The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ... [  Character flashes red as the background turns grim and dark.  ] but their love was strong and they found a way.",22
Katara,[  Voice-over.  ] The two lovers learned earthbending from the badgermoles; they became the first earthbenders.,22
Katara,"[  Voice-over.  ] They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly. [  The pattern of a labyrinth appears.  ] Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth. [  The couple kisses.  ] But, one day, the man didn't come [  Cuts to a shot of the woman alone, looking startled.  ] - he'd died in the war between the two villages. [  Arrows fly by the screen. The woman is seen weeping by a grave.  ] Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ... [  The woman is seen displaying her immense earthbending power.  ] but, instead, she declared the war over. [  Cuts to shot of the woman standing on a hill surrounded by the two villages.  ] Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace. [  Shows picture of the current-day Omashu.  ] The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. [  The characters for ""Oma"" appear followed by the character for ""Shu"". Flashback ends.  ] The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.",22
Katara,[  Reading the inscription on the relief in the wall.  ] Love is brightest [  Cuts to shot of a carving of the couple kissing.  ] in the dark.,22
Moku,"Oh, great! Your plans have led us to  another  dead end!",22
Sokka,"[  Defensively.  ] At least I'm  thinking  of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku.",22
Chong,"Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We're thinking of  ideas‌  ? Because I've had an idea for, like, an hour now.",22
Sokka,[  Angrily; spreads arms out dramatically.  ] Yes! We're all thinking of ideas!,22
Chong,"Well, then listen to this: If love is the key out of here, then all we need to do is play a love song! [  Begins playing song much to Sokka's dismay.  ]",22
Aang,How are we going to find our way out of these tunnels?,22
Katara,I have a crazy idea.,22
Aang,[  Curiously.  ] What?,22
Katara,"[  Hesitant. Walks away, slightly embarrassed.  ] Never mind. It's too crazy.",22
Aang,"Katara, what is it?",22
Katara,I was thinking ... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love ...,22
Aang,Right ...,22
Katara,"[  Turns to face him and gestures to the portrait.  ] And here, it says, ""Love is brightest in the dark,"" and has a picture of them kissing.",22
Aang,[  Utterly confused and lost.  ] Where are you going with this?,22
Katara,"[  Shyly, blushing.  ] Well, what if we ... kissed?",22
Aang,[  Very surprised.  ] Us ...  kissing‌  ?,22
Katara,See? It was a crazy idea.,22
Aang,[  Dreamily.  ] Us ...  kissing  ...,22
Katara,[  Fake-jokingly.  ] Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine  that‌  ?,22
Aang,[  Fake-jokingly.  ] Yeah. [  Awkwardly laughs.  ] I definitely wouldn't want to kiss  you  ! [  Beat.  ],22
Katara,"[  Insulted.  ] Oh, well! I didn't realize it was  such  a  horrible  option. [  Angrily.  ] Sorry I suggested it!",22
Aang,"[  Realizing his mistake.  ] No, no, I mean ... if there was a choice between kissing you and  dying  ...",22
Katara,[  Disgusted.  ] Ugh!,22
Aang,[  Desperately.  ] What? I'm saying is I would rather kiss you than die - that's a compliment.,22
Katara,"[  Angered.  ] Well, I'm not sure  which  I'd rather do! [  Slams the torch into his hand and storms away.  ]",22
Aang,[  Miserably.  ] What is  wrong  with me ...,22
Chong,"[  Singing.  ] Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart ...",22
Iroh,Thank you for the duck. It was excellent.,22
Song's mother,You're welcome. It brings me pleasure to see someone eat my cooking with such ... gusto.,22
Iroh,[  Pats his stomach in a contented manner.  ] Much practice.,22
Iroh,"Junior, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people.",22
Zuko,[  Turns and bows.  ] Thank you.,22
Song,"I know you don't think there's any hope left in the world, but there is hope. The Avatar has returned.",22
Zuko,[  Bitterly.  ] I know.,22
Iroh,What are you doing? These people just showed you great kindness.,22
Zuko,They're about to show us a little more kindness. Well?,22
Aang,"We're going to run out of light any second now, aren't we?",22
Katara,I think so ...,22
Aang,"Then, what are we going to do?",22
Katara,What  can  we do?,22
Chong,"Hey! You saved us, Sokka!",22
Sokka,"No, they were trying to get away from something!",22
Chong,From what?,22
Chong,"Hey, those things are music lovers!",22
Sokka,"[  Singing nervously.  ] Badgermoles coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out!",22
Chong,"[  Singing.  ] The big, bad badgermoles who earthbend the tunnels, hate the wolfbats, but love the sounds!",22
Aang,They're made of some kind of crystal. They must only light up in the dark.,22
Katara,That's how the two lovers found each other. [  Gestures with her hand along the ceiling.  ] They just put out their lights and followed the crystals. [  Sees the exit.  ] That must be the way out! [  The two hug.  ],22
Aang,"So, uh ...",22
Katara,Let's go!,22
Aang,What about Sokka?,22
Katara,Sokka!,22
Sokka,How did you guys get out?,22
Aang,"Just like the legend said, we let love lead the way. [  Smiles sheepishly.  ]",22
Sokka,"Really? We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way.",22
Katara,Why is your forehead all red?,22
Chong,[  Talking about Aang.  ] Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you: I think that kid might be the Avatar!,22
Aang,So are you guys going to come to Omashu with us?,22
Moku,Nope.,22
Aang,"Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku.",22
Chong,"Sokka, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the way of the journey. [  Hugs him.  ]",22
Sokka,[  Irritated yet blushing.  ] Just play your songs.,22
Chong,"Hey! Good plan! [  Begins playing his lute and singing. Cuts to shot of Team Avatar.  ] Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart. Da, da, da ...",22
Sokka,"[  From afar.  ] The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about: the destination. [  Close-up of him.  ] I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O- [  Pauses abruptly.  ] Oh no ...",22
Aang,"[  Viewing the city, his back to the camera; in a somewhat shocked tone.  ] I can't believe it. I know the War has spread far, [  Turning toward the camera sadly.  ] but Omashu always seemed ... untouchable.",23
Sokka,Up until now it was. [  Crosses arms over chest.  ] Now Ba Sing Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.,23
Katara,"[  Cuts to shot of entire group standing on the cliffside overlooking the city.  ] This is horrible, [  Approaches Aang; cuts to side-view of the two standing next to each other.  ] but we have to move on.",23
Aang,"No, I'm going in to find Bumi.",23
Sokka,"Aang, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still ...",23
Aang,[  Angrily.  ] What? If he's still what?,23
Sokka,[  Unsurely.  ] A-around.,23
Katara,"I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people who can teach you earthbending.",23
Aang,This isn't about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend.,23
Sokka,A secret passage? Why didn't we just use this last time?,23
Sokka,Ugh!,23
Aang,That answer your question?,23
Sokka,Eww!,23
Katara,That wasn't as bad as I thought.,23
Sokka,[  In a panicking tone while trying to yank the pentapox off.  ] Ahh! They won't let go! Help!,23
Aang,[  Quickly tackles Sokka into a wall in order to slience him; in a somewhat cheerful tone.  ] Shh! Stop making so much noise. It's just a purple pentapus.,23
Guard one,Hey! What are you kids doing out past curfew?,23
Katara,Sorry. We were just on our way home.,23
Guard one,"[  Notices the spots where the pentapus was attached to Sokka.  ] Wait, what's the matter with him?",23
Katara,"Uh, he has pentapox, sir. [  As he approaches.  ] Umm, it's highly contagious.",23
Sokka,"[  Exaggerating.  ] Oh, it's so awful. I'm dying.",23
Katara,And deadly.,23
Guard two,"Hey, I think I heard of pentapox! Didn't your cousin Chang die of it?",23
Guard one,"We'd better go wash our hands, and burn our clothes.",23
Aang,"Thank you, sewer friends.",23
Li,"When tracking your brother and uncle, traveling with the royal procession may no longer be an option.",23
Lo,May no longer be wise.,23
Lo and Li,If you hope to keep the element of surprise.,23
Azula,"You're right. The Royal Procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I must be agile, nimble. I need a small, elite team. It's time to visit some old friends.",23
Katara,Let's find Bumi and get out of here.,23
Sokka,Where would they be keeping him?,23
Aang,Somewhere he can't earthbend. Somewhere made of metal.,23
Mai,There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place.,23
Michi,"Mai, your father was appointed governor. We're like royalty here. Be happy and enjoy it.",23
Resistance fighter,The targets are approaching.,23
Yung,Take them out.,23
Mai,"[  In a dull tone.  ] I thought my life was boring in the Fire Nation, but this place is unbearably bleak. Nothing ever happens.",23
Michi,[  Pointing at Aang.  ] The resistance!,23
Azula,"Ty Lee, could that possibly be you?",23
Ty Lee,Azula!,23
Ty Lee,It is so good to see you!,23
Azula,"Please, don't let me interrupt your ... [  Raises an eyebrow in wonder.  ] whatever it is you were doing.",23
Azula,"[  Glances around.  ] Tell me, what is the daughter of a nobleman doing here? [  Looks back at Ty Lee.  ] Certainly our parents didn't send us to the Royal Fire Academy for Girls to end up in ... [  Looks to her side.  ] places like this.",23
Azula,I have a proposition for you.,23
Azula,"I'm hunting a traitor. [  While looking casually at her nails.  ] You remember my old fuddy-duddy uncle, don't you?",23
Ty Lee,"[  Resting on her chest and elbows, but now with her both feet resting on her head.  ] Oh yeah. He was so funny.",23
Azula,I would be honored if you would join me on my mission.,23
Ty Lee,"Oh ... I ... uh ... would love to. [  She stands up in a fluid elegant movement.  ] But the truth is, I'm really happy here. [  Smiling sincerely.  ] I mean, my aura has never been pinker!",23
Azula,"[  Raising up her hand in a ""stop"" motion to Ty Lee.  ] I'll take your word for it. Well, I wouldn't want you to give up the life you love just to please me.",23
Ty Lee,"[  Bows in respect.  ] Thank you, Azula. [  Continues stretching.  ]",23
Azula,"[  While walking away.  ] Of course, before I leave, I'm going to catch your show.",23
Ty Lee,[  Hesitantly.  ] Uh ... yeah ... sure ... uh ... of course ...,23
Aang,"So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance?",23
Yung,"Of course not! The day of the invasion, we readied ourselves for battle. We were prepared to defend our city ... to fight for our lives and for our freedom. But before we even had a chance, King Bumi surrendered.",23
Yung,"The day of the invasion, I asked King Bumi what he wanted to do. [  Cut to his close-up.  ] He looked me in the eye and said ...",23
King Bumi,I'm going to do ... nothing! [  He starts to laugh and snort like the mad lunatic he is.  ],23
Yung,It doesn't matter now. [  Cut to Aang who sadly lowers his eyes as the resistance leader continues.  ] Fighting the Fire Nation is the only path to freedom. [  Switch to a close-up of Yung again.  ] And freedom is worth dying for.,23
Aang,"Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation. [  The camera pans to the right, showing several Earth Kingdom soldiers.  ] But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day.",23
Yung,"You don't understand. They've taken our home, and we have to fight them at any cost! [  He makes some powerful hand gestures to make his point more clear.  ]",23
Resistance fighter #1,"[  In a soft tone.  ] I don't know, Yung, living to fight another day is startin' to sound pretty good to me.",23
Resistance fighter #2,"[  He takes a step forward and points toward himself. He addresses Yung with a decisive tone.  ] Yeah, I'm with the kid!",23
Yung,Fine. But there's thousands of citizens that need to leave. How're we going to get them all out?,23
Sokka,Suckers!,23
Sokka,You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.,23
Sokka,"The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta act sick too. Ya gotta sell it!",23
Sokka,[  Grabs the guy who is standing next to him and points at the old man.  ] Now that's what I'm talkin' about.,23
Old man,Years of practice.,23
Sokka,Okay everyone! Into sick formation.,23
Katara,"Aang, what are you doing? Aren't you coming with us?",23
Aang,[  He turns around.  ] No. I'm not leaving until I find Bumi.,23
Aang,"Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later.",23
Soldier,Plague! Plague!,23
Ukano,What is going on down there?,23
Guard,I saw some kids yesterday who were sick with pentapox. It must have spread!,23
Ukano,"Pentapox! [  He pulls his beard.  ] Hmm, I'm pretty sure I've heard of that.",23
Michi,"Oh, this is terrible.",23
Guard,What should we do?,23
Ukano,Drive them out of the city [  He points toward the gates.  ] ... but don't touch them! We have to rid the city of this disease!,23
Mai,"Fire flakes, Dad?",23
Michi,[  Gasping.  ] How awful!,23
Aang,Flopsie!,23
Aang,"Come on, Flopsie. [  He climbs on top of Flopsie.  ] You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! [  Flopsie does not move a muscle.  ] Oh ... I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go!",23
Shuzumu,We're deeply honored to have the Fire Lord's daughter at our humble circus.,23
Shuzumu,Uh ... tell us if there is anything we can do to make the show more enjoyable.,23
Azula,I will.,23
Azula,Incredible. Do you think she'll fall?,23
Shuzumu,Of course not.,23
Azula,Then wouldn't it make it more interesting if you removed the net?,23
Shuzumu,[  Concerned.  ] Uh ... the thing is ... the performers ...,23
Azula,"You're right, you're right. That's been done. [  After a short pause, she continues with a tone of dark pleasure.  ] I know. Set the net on fire.",23
Shuzumu,"[  Worried.  ] Of course, Princess.",23
Azula,"[  Ecstatic.  ] Brilliant, just brilliant! [  She looks down at Shuzumu and asks happily.  ] Ooh, what kind of dangerous animals do you have?",23
Shuzumu,"Well, our circus boasts the most exotic assortment-",23
Azula,Release them all!,23
Aang,[  Sadly.  ] We looked everywhere. No Bumi.,23
Yung,We've got a problem. We just did a head count.,23
Katara,"[  Worried, turns back to Yung.  ] Oh no. Did someone get left behind?",23
Yung,"No, we have an extra.",23
Ukano,"So, the resistance has kidnapped my son. Everything so clever, so tricky. Just like their King Bumi.",23
Guard,"What do you want to do, sir?",23
Azula,What an exquisite performance. I can't wait to see how you'll top yourself tomorrow.,23
Ty Lee,"[  Smiling at Azula's reflection in the mirror.  ] I'm sorry Azula, but unfortunately there won't be a show tomorrow.",23
Azula,Really?,23
Ty Lee,[  Hangs up her tiara.  ] The universe has given me strong hints that it's time for a career change. [  She gets up and turns around to face Azula.  ] I want to join you on your mission.,23
Sokka,No! Bad Fire Nation baby!,23
Sokka,[  Annoyed.  ] Oh ... all right.,23
Katara,"[  Baby voice.  ] Oooh, you're so cute. [  She kisses him on the cheek, while an annoyed Sokka looks the other side, resting his head on his hand.  ] Mmmmm ...",23
Yung,"Sure he's cute now, but when he's older, he'll join the Fire Nation army. [  Switch to Katara who is happily playing with the baby under the annoyed gaze of her brother.  ] You won't think he's so cute then. He'll be a killer.",23
Katara,Does that look like the face of a killer to you?,23
Yung,A messenger hawk!,23
Aang,"It's from the Fire Nation governor. He thinks we kidnapped his son. [  Switch to another view. Aang is shown standing at the other side of the campfire, reading the message.  ] So ... he wants to make a trade. His son [  Zoom to Aang's surprised face while he continues dramatically, his eyes widening.  ] for King Bumi.",23
Sokka,You realize we're probably walking right into a trap.,23
Aang,I don't think so. I'm sure the governor wants his son back as much as we want Bumi. [  Smiling at the sleeping baby he holds against his chest.  ] It's a new day. I have a good feeling about this.,23
Mai,Please tell me you're here to kill me.,23
Azula,"[  Placing her hands on Mai's shoulders.  ] It's great to see you, Mai.",23
Mai,I thought you ran off and joined the circus. You said it was your calling.,23
Ty Lee,"[  Releases Mai.  ] Well, Azula called a little louder.",23
Azula,I have a mission and I need you both. [  Azula places a hand on both her friends' shoulders.  ],23
Mai,Count me in. Anything to get me out of this place. [  She looks annoyed at the palace.  ],23
Ukano,I apologize. [  Switch to a closer shot of the governor who squatting down on a pillow.  ] You've come to Omashu at a difficult time. At noon we're making a trade with the resistance to get Tom-Tom back.,23
Azula,"Yes, I'm so sorry to hear about your son, but really, [  She crosses her legs and clasps her hands.  ] what did you expect by just letting all the citizens leave? [  She stands up, addressing the governor in a harsher tone.  ] My father has trusted you with this city and you're making a mess of things! [  She emphasizes her words with a hand gesture.  ]",23
Ukano,"Forgive me, Princess.",23
Azula,"You stay here. [  Mai and Ty Lee get up behind her.  ] Mai will handle the hostage trade so you don't have a chance to mess it up. [  Cut to a shot of the still smoking city of Omashu, followed by some shots of Fire Nation construction sites.  ] And there is no more ""Omashu"". I'm renaming it in honor of my father, the city of New Ozai.",23
King Bumi,"[  Chuckling.  ] Hi, everybody!",23
Mai,You brought my brother?,23
Aang,He's here. We're ready to trade.,23
Azula,"[  To Mai.  ] I'm sorry, but a thought just occurred to me. Do you mind?",23
Mai,"[  Turning to Azula.  ] Of course not, Princess Azula.",23
Azula,"We're trading a two year old for a king. [  Looks up at Bumi.  ] A powerful, earthbending king?",23
King Bumi,[  Nods.  ] Mmm hmmm!,23
Azula,"It just doesn't seem like a fair trade, does it?",23
Mai,You're right. [  Azula smiles slyly while Mai walks forward.  ] The deal's off.,23
King Bumi,[  Clearly amused by all this.  ] Whhhoa! See you all later!,23
Aang,Bumi!,23
Azula,[  Surprised.  ] The Avatar!,23
Azula,My lucky day.,23
King Bumi,"[  Surprised.  ] Aang, is that you? Where did you come from?",23
Aang,Hang on! We're gonna get you out of here.,23
Katara,We've got to get the baby out of here!,23
Sokka,[  Blows on the bison whistle before looking at his sister with a big smile.  ] Way ahead of ya! [  Tom-Tom reaches for the whistle and starts to play with it.  ],23
King Bumi,"Aang, stop your blowing for a minute.",23
King Bumi,Now hold on just a [  The swing of Aang's staff breaks the frozen chain and they freefall down.  ] duahhh!!!,23
Aang,"It's just like old times, isn't it, Bumi?",23
King Bumi,"[  Looking serious.  ] Aang, I need to talk to you!",23
Aang,It's good to see you too!,23
Mai,[  Taunting.  ] How are you gonna fight without your bending?,23
Sokka,[  Catching the boomerang.  ] I seem to manage!,23
Katara,There's Aang!,23
Sokka,[  Gazing in the direction Katara pointed.  ] We can catch him!,23
Aang,"Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here!",23
Aang,[  Shocked.  ] You could earthbend? All along?,23
King Bumi,"Well, they didn't cover my face.",23
Aang,"[  Slightly annoyed and angry.  ] I don't understand. Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi?",23
King Bumi,"[  Calmly.  ] Listen to me, Aang. There are options in fighting, called jing. It's a choice of how you direct your energy.",23
Aang,"[  Cut to a close-up of an annoyed Aang, counting along on his fingers as he sums up the different jings.  ] I know! There's positive jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating.",23
King Bumi,[  Happily smiling.  ] ... and neutral jing when you do nothing!,23
Aang,[  He looks shocked at his three raised fingers.  ] There are  three  jings?,23
King Bumi,"Well, technically there are eighty-five, but let's just focus on the third. Neutral jing is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike.",23
Aang,"[  Starting to understand.  ] That's why you surrendered, isn't it?",23
King Bumi,"Yes, and it's why I can't leave now.",23
Aang,[  Disappointed.  ] I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.,23
King Bumi,Your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jing. You need to find someone who waits and listens before striking.,23
Aang,"[  Happily.  ] Hey, Momo!",23
King Bumi,Momo's mastered a few jings himself!,23
King Bumi,"Goodbye, Aang. I'll see you when the time is right.",23
Mai,"So, we're tracking down your brother and Uncle, huh?",23
Ty Lee,"[  Turning to Mai.  ] It'll be interesting seeing Zuko again, [  Teasing.  ] won't it, Mai?",23
Azula,It's not just Zuko and Iroh anymore. [  Cut closer to Azula who continues on a serious tone.  ] We have a third target now.,23
Michi,Tom-Tom!,23
Iroh,[  Somewhat enthusiastically.  ] Spare coins for weary travelers?,24
Zuko,"[  Angrily, with his arms folded.  ] This is humiliating! We're royalty! These people should be giving us whatever we want.",24
Iroh,They will if you ask nicely. [  A peasant woman strolls past; somewhat dramatically.  ] Spare change for a hungry old man?,24
Peasant girl,"[  Withdrawing a coin from her sleeve.  ] Aw, here you go.",24
Iroh,"The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile!",24
Broadsword man,[  Smiling.  ] How about some entertainment in exchange for ... a gold piece? [  He pulls the piece from his pocket with a flourish.  ],24
Zuko,[  Annoyed.  ] We're  not  performers.,24
Iroh,"[  Standing up.  ] Not professional anyway. [  He puts the hat down and stands up, swaying lightly as he begins to sing.  ] It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city, they look so pretty!",24
Broadsword man,"[  Annoyed with the quality of the entertainment.  ] Come on, we're talking a  gold  piece here! Let's see some action! [  Zuko glances up sharply as the man withdraws his swords.  ] Dance!",24
Iroh,[  Singing.  ] They kiss so sweet that you really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se!,24
Broadsword man,"[  Stops slicing and laughs.  ] Ha, ha! Nothing like a fat man dancing for his dinner! Here ya go! [  Tosses the gold coin onto the ground and walks away.  ]",24
Iroh,[  Dramatically; close to tears.  ] Such a kind man.,24
Sokka,"[  To Aang.  ] Hey, you taking us down for a reason? [  Aang continues to stare at the swamp.  ] Aang, [  Aang snaps out of the trance.  ] why are we going down?",24
Aang,[  Confused.  ] What? I didn't even notice.,24
Sokka,Are you noticing now?,24
Katara,[  Moving to the front of the saddle.  ] Is something wrong?,24
Aang,"[  He still seems somewhat dazed by the swamp.  ] I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me.",24
Sokka,[  Holding his stomach.  ] Is it telling you where we can get something to eat?,24
Aang,"No, I ... I think it wants us to land there.",24
Sokka,"[  Shrugging.  ] No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.",24
Aang,"I don't know. Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it?",24
Sokka,Yes.,24
Katara,I don't know. There's something ominous about that place.,24
Sokka,"See, even Appa and Momo don't like it here.",24
Aang,"[  Resignedly.  ] Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this, [  Looks at swamp.  ] bye swamp. [  Shakes Appa's rope.  ] Yip, Yip!",24
Sokka,"[  Panicked.  ] You better throw in an extra ""yip""! We gotta move!",24
Aang,"[  Looking around the swamp and at his friends.  ] Where's Appa and Momo? [  Aang jumps up to the top of the trees, looking for his animal friends as he uses the height to search for them.  ] Appa! Momo!",24
Katara,"[  Pointing blandly.  ] Sokka, you've got an elbow leech.",24
Sokka,"[  He spins around, panicking, trying to find it.  ] Where? Where?",24
Katara,[  Crosses her arms; sarcastically.  ] Where do you think?,24
Sokka,[  Ripping off the elbow leech and throwing it behind to Katara. He cries out angrily.  ] Why do things keep attaching to me?!,24
Katara,You couldn't find them?,24
Aang,"[  Jumping down into the muddy water.  ] No, and the tornado ... it just disappeared.",24
Sokka,[  Cutting the vines with his machete.  ] We better speed things up.,24
Aang,[  To Sokka.  ] Maybe we should be a little nicer to the swamp.,24
Sokka,"[  Continuing to cut the vines.  ] Aang, these are just plants. Do you want me to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" as I swing my machete back and forth?",24
Katara,Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels ...  alive.,24
Sokka,"I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can.",24
Katara,[  Yelling.  ] Appa! Momo!,24
Sokka,There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them. We'll have to make camp for the night.,24
Katara,What was that?,24
Sokka,"Nothing, just swamp gas. [  Indicating.  ] Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here.",24
Sokka,"[  Sweating, his voice cracking.  ] I think we should build a fire.",24
Aang,"Sokka, the longer we're here, the more I think you shouldn't be doing do that.",24
Sokka,"No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine. [  Grabs a nearby root.  ] Right, swamp? [  Shakes the root and fakes a reply.  ] ""No problem, Sokka!""",24
Katara,Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?,24
Sokka,"Please, we're all alone out here.",24
Aang,Except for them.,24
Sokka,"[  His calm demeanor vanishing.  ] Right, except for them.",24
Aang,Guys?,24
Due,"What'd you reckon make a track like that, Tho?",24
Tho,"Don't know, Due. [  Points his stick at the footprint.  ] Some'in with six legs. Pretty big'uns too.",24
Due,"Leaves a nice, wide trail to folla'.",24
Tho,You know what's at the end of that trail?,24
Tho,[  Grinning.  ] Dinner.,24
Katara,[  Calling out.  ] Aang! Sokka!,24
Katara,Hello? Hello? Can you help me? [  She squints.  ] Mom? [  More loudly and running toward the figure.  ] Mom!,24
Katara,I can't believe ...,24
Sokka,"Aang! [  While slashing at the vines.  ] Stupid swamp! Dumb, ugly vines! Katara! [  He becomes caught, and grunts with exertion before slicing himself free.  ] You think you're so tough, huh?",24
Sokka,"Hello? Yue? [  He takes a hold of his head, before removing his hands and shrugging, turning away from the apparition.  ] This is just a trick of the light ... swamp gas ... I ... hit my head running away last night. I'm going crazy. [  Almost fearfully, he turns around and walks closer.  ]",24
Princess Yue,[  Accusingly.  ] You didn't protect me.,24
Aang,Katara! Appa!,24
Aang,Hello? Who are you?,24
Aang,"Hey, come back! [  He holds his hand out as though to grab her.  ]",24
Due,Look at that Tho. Is that a little hairy fella ridin' that thing?,24
Tho,"No, that's what they call a ""lemoo"". Saw one at a traveling show once. Real smart they say.",24
Due,Bet he tastes a lot like possum chicken.,24
Tho,You think everything tastes like possum chicken.,24
Due,"C'mon now, fellas. [  He moves to the front of the boat.  ] Just a little closer. Nice and easy. Nothing to worry about. We just fixin' to eat ya.",24
Tho,[  Annoyed.  ] What'd you say that fer?,24
Due,"[  Shrugging as he tries to appease his friend.  ] Well, we are!",24
Tho,But you don't have to tell 'em that.,24
Due,[  He shrugs again.  ] Well how'd I know they'd understand me?,24
Tho,Come on!,24
Aang,Who are you?,24
Sokka,[  He stands up and puts his machete away.  ] What do you guys think you're doing!? I've been looking all over for you!,24
Katara,"[  She has not moved, although her hand is on her head as she sits on the root they have fallen onto.  ] Well, I've been wandering around looking for you!",24
Aang,[  He looks away before airbending himself to his feet. He appears embarrassed that he was not actively searching for his friends like they were him.  ] I was chasing some girl.,24
Katara,What girl?,24
Aang,[  He walks over to Katara and helps her up before rubbing his ear.  ] I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress.,24
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically, with exaggerated hand movements.  ] Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!",24
Katara,I thought I saw Mom.,24
Sokka,"Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here.",24
Katara,[  Surprised.  ] You saw something too?,24
Sokka,"[  He looks away for a moment, before turning back and taking a step closer to his sister.  ] I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything. Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot.",24
Aang,What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here.,24
Katara,Okay ... so where's here? The middle of the swamp?,24
Aang,"Yeah, the center ... it's the heart of the swamp. It's been calling us here. I knew it.",24
Sokka,"It's just a tree. [  He raises his arms above his head.  ] It can't call anyone. For the last time, there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here.",24
Tho,"Now, what would a lemoo need a shirt fer?",24
Sokka,There's someone in there! He's bending the vines!,24
Aang,[  Demanding offensively.  ] Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us!?,24
Huu,Wait! [  The vines drop to reveal a slightly larger man wearing nothing but a leaf loincloth.  ] I didn't call you here.,24
Aang,"[  He shares a look of confusion with Sokka, who is also in an offensive stance.  ] We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land.",24
Sokka,He's the Avatar. Stuff like that happens to us a lot.,24
Huu,The Avatar? Come with me.,24
Katara,"So, who are you then?",24
Huu,"[  Bending a vine out of the way.  ] I protect the swamp from folks that want to hurt it, like this fella with his big knife.",24
Sokka,"See, completely reasonable. [  He finally puts his machete away.  ] Not a monster, just a regular guy defending his home. Nothing mystical about it.",24
Huu,"Oh the swamp is a mystical place all right. It's sacred. I reached enlightenment right here under the banyan-grove tree. [  He sits on the tree, looking at the group as he explains.  ] I heard it calling me, just like you did.",24
Sokka,[  Humoring Huu.  ] Sure you did. It seems real chatty.,24
Huu,"[  The camera zooms out as he explains, slowly revealing more and more of the swamp. It shows how large the banyan-grove tree is compared to the others, but at the final magnification, it is impossible to distinguish it from the other trees.  ] See this whole swamp is actually just one tree spread out over miles. Branches spread and sink, take root, and spread some more. One big, living organism. Just like the entire world.",24
Aang,"[  Cuts back to Aang, looking at Huu. He is still openly skeptical.  ] I get how the tree is one big thing, but the whole world?",24
Huu,"Sure. You think you're any different from me or your friends or this tree? If you listen hard enough, you can hear every living thing breathing together. [  Another shot shows the swamp river. There are the sounds of several animals heard in the background.  ] You can feel everything growing. We're all living together, even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots and we are all branches of the same tree.",24
Katara,"[  She and her friends are now sitting, listening to Huu.  ] But what did our visions mean?",24
Huu,"In the swamp, we see visions of people we've lost, people we loved, folks we think are gone. [  The shot cuts to show the people that Sokka and Katara saw in the swamp, before cutting back to Huu.  ] But the swamp tells us they're not. We're still connected to them. Time is an illusion and so is death.",24
Aang,But what about my vision? It was someone I had never met.,24
Huu,You're the Avatar. You tell me.,24
Aang,"[  He looks down as he tries to understand.  ] Time is an illusion. So, it's someone I will meet.",24
Sokka,"Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to find Appa and Momo.",24
Aang,"I think I know how to find them. [  Aang kneels down and places his hand on the tree.  ] Everything is connected. [  Energy travels from Aang's hand to Appa's location. Appa is seen being captured by the Foggy Swamp members. Back at the banyan-grove tree, Aang stands up.  ] Come on! We've got to hurry!",24
Tho,[  Singing and tapping the side of his canoe. Momo is seen struggling inside the sack he has been placed in.  ] Set my lines by the river bed! Caught ten fish and I killed 'em dead! Cut 'em and gut 'em and I tossed the heads in the water to keep them catgators fed.,24
Aang,Appa!,24
Due,We're under attack!,24
Katara,"Hey, you guys are waterbenders!",24
Due,"You too! That means we're kin! [  Due ceases waterbending, followed by a slightly disgusted Katara. He watches as Sokka and Huu run up to the branch Katara and Aang are standing on.  ] Hey Huu! How you been?",24
Huu,"You know, scared some folks, swung some vines, the usual.",24
Sokka,Huu?,24
Due,How you like that possum chicken?,24
Sokka,Tastes just like arctic hen. So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa? [  He indicates the catgator lying behind Tho.  ] You've got plenty of those big things wandering around.,24
Due,You want me to eat old Slim? He's like a member of the family!,24
Sokka,Nice Slim!,24
Due,"[  Laughing.  ] Oh, he don't eat no bugs! That's people food.",24
Tho,Where'd you say you was from?,24
Katara,[  Smiling. Sokka is shown chewing nonchalantly next to her.  ] The South Pole.,24
Tho,"Didn't know there was waterbenders anywhere but here. They got a nice swamp there, do they?",24
Katara,"No, it's all ice and snow.",24
Tho,Hmm. No wonder you left.,24
Sokka,"[  To Katara.  ] Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here. [  He raises his arms for emphasis.  ] Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp.",24
Katara,What about the visions?,24
Sokka,"I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug!",24
Aang,[  Feeding Momo.  ] But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?,24
Sokka,"That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count. [  To Huu.  ] The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down.",24
Huu,I can't do anything like that. I just bend the water in the plants.,24
Sokka,"Well, no accounting for weather. Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp.",24
Broadsword man,Who's there?,24
Sokka,"[  Angrily.  ] What are you doing in my mouth? [  Momo chitters happily while lying upside down on Sokka's belly, chewing on the fly he ""rescued"" from the spider's web.  ] Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.",25
Mongke,[  Shouting from up above as he looks over the campsite.  ] Give up! You're completely surrounded!,25
Sokka,[  Crawling toward Appa.  ] Come on! Come on! Come on!,25
Katara,My scrolls!,25
Aang,[  Shocked.  ] My staff!,25
Aang,Yip yip!,25
Sokka,"[  Stretching out his arm over the saddle as if he wants to grab it.  ] Wait, my boomerang!",25
Katara,[  Grabbing Sokka's arm.  ] There's no time!,25
Sokka,"[  Annoyed.  ] Oh, I see, [  Turning to Katara.  ] so there's time to get your scrolls [  Turning toward Aang.  ] and time to get your staff, [  Looking back at Katara with his hand on his chest.  ] but no time for my boomerang?",25
Katara,[  Cheerfully.  ] That's correct!,25
Sokka,[  Bowing his head in defeat by this totally honest answer.  ] Oh.,25
Aang,"[  To a sulking Sokka.  ] Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.",25
Sokka,"[  Sadly.  ] I feel like I've lost part of my identity. [  He jumps up and moves Aang's hat slightly so that he can point at Aang's arrow.  ] Imagine if you lost your arrow, or Katara lost her ... [  Makes a hair loopies gesture with a somewhat bored look.  ] hair loopies.",25
Merchant,"Here's your produce, ponytail guy.",25
Sokka,"[  He picks up the basket full of supplies, looking dejected at the nickname.  ] I used to be boomerang guy ...",25
Merchant,"[  Surprised, after inspecting the money.  ] Hey, Water Tribe money!",25
Katara,I hope that's okay.,25
Merchant,"[  Clutching the coin.  ] So long as it's money. [  The merchant closes his shop, while Katara walks over to Aang, who is trying to console a crying Sokka as the camera pans up to show just the merchant's head.  ] Have a nice Avatar Day!",25
Aang,[  Interested.  ] Avatar Day?,25
Merchant,"[  Turning around while waving.  ] You guys are going to the festival, right?",25
Aang,There's a holiday for the Avatar. Who knew?,25
Katara,[  Pointing at the float.  ] Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float!,25
Sokka,And here comes Avatar Roku! [  Roku effigy rolls by.  ],25
Aang,"Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated.",25
Sokka,And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food! [  He takes a huge bite out of the food-item he is holding.  ],25
Katara,"[  Pointing at a giant float of Aang coming down the street.  ] Aang, look!",25
Aang,That's the biggest me I've ever seen!,25
Sokka,"Now a torch, that's a nice prop. It's bright, dangerous ... [  Sniffs.  ] smells manly. But I'm not sure I could carry it off.",25
Katara,"[  Surprised.  ] Hey, what's that guy doing?",25
Villagers,[  Chanting as Kyoshi's effigy is consumed by the flames.  ] Down with the Avatar!,25
Iroh,[  Wondering.  ] Where did you get these?,25
Zuko,"[  Angrily, while walking away.  ] What does it matter where they came from?",25
Iroh,[  Seriously.  ] Mmmm ... [  Takes a bite out of one of the cupcakes Zuko brought. The jam drips of his chin. In delight.  ] ... mmmm!,25
Villager,[  Angrily pointing an accusing finger at Katara.  ] That party pooper's ruining Avatar Day!,25
Aang,[  Angered.  ] That party pooper's my friend! [  He takes off his hat and throws it away to reveal his arrow.  ],25
Tong,[  Pointing in shock at Aang.  ] It's the Avatar himself!,25
Villager,[  Scared.  ] It's going to kill us with its awesome Avatar powers!,25
Aang,"No, I'm not, I ...",25
Tong,"[  Crawling back on his feet.  ] I suggest you leave! [  He waves them away with a gesture of his hand.  ] You're not welcome here, Avatar!",25
Katara,Why not? Aang helps people.,25
Aang,[  Landing beside Katara.  ] It's true! I'm on your side.,25
Tong,"[  Calmly.  ] I find that hard to swallow, [  Raising his voice.  ] considering what you did to us in your past life! It was Avatar Kyoshi; she murdered our glorious leader, Chin the Great.",25
Aang,[  Utterly shocked.  ] You think that I ... murdered someone?,25
Villager #2,[  Lisping and slurring.  ] We used to be a great society before you killed our leader. [  Pointing at himself as the camera zooms in on him.  ] Now look at us!,25
Aang,[  Frightened by the appearances of the old man.  ] Huh!,25
Katara,[  Katara places her arms on Aang's shoulders and starts to defend him.  ] Aang would never do something like that. No Avatar would. [  Shaking her head in disapproval before pointing an accusing finger at the villagers.  ] And it's not fair for you all to question his honor!,25
Villager #3,"[  Raising his arm to emphasize his remark.  ] Let's tell her what we all think of the Avatar's ""honor""!",25
Aang,Give me a chance to clear my name!,25
Tong,The only way to prove your innocence is to stand trial.,25
Aang,[  Confidently.  ] I'll gladly stand trial!,25
Tong,You'll have to follow all our rules. That includes paying bail.,25
Aang,No problem.,25
Aang,[  Apologetically.  ] How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?,25
Sokka,"So some people don't like you, big deal! There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you. Now let's bust you out of here!",25
Aang,I can't.,25
Sokka,"[  Upbeat.  ] Sure you can! A little [  Theatrically jumps back and pretends to airbend by blowing air. Katara looks ashamed for her brother. He moves to the back of the room to ""cut"" the air.  ] swish-swish-swish! [  He makes a grotesque movement with his arm before thrusting his face in the camera.  ] Airbending slice! [  He resumes his place beside Katara, who is still looking annoyed by her brother. He makes a circular motion with his hands and points toward the door.  ] And we're on our way!",25
Katara,"[  Slightly mocking.  ] I think what ""Master Swish"" is trying to say [  Serious tone as she looks at Aang.  ] is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here.",25
Aang,[  Unhappy.  ] I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence.,25
Sokka,How're we gonna to do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago.,25
Aang,"[  Cunningly.  ] That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective.",25
Sokka,"[  Content.  ] Well, I guess I could be classified as such.",25
Katara,"[  Aiding Aang by playing Sokka's ego.  ] Yeah! Back home, he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky.",25
Sokka,"[  Bragging.  ] Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots! [  Katara holds her hand to her brow, annoyed by Sokka's monologue.  ] See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. [  Aang is making fun of Sokka, Katara holds her hand to her mouth to refrain herself from bursting out in laughs.  ] Okay, I guess I am pretty good.",25
Aang,"So, you'll help me with my case?",25
Sokka,"[  Pretends to ponder about the question. Katara stares at him, trying to figure out what he is doing.  ] Fine! But I'm going to need some new props. [  The camera spins around. When it stops again, Sokka is wearing a hat with a monocle.  ] I'm ready. [  Katara looks surprised at his new outfit and giggles. Sokka extends his monocle to investigate her.  ] What?",25
Tong,"This is the crime scene. [  Cut to Sokka, who inquisitively looks around. He gazes directly into the camera lens through his magnifying glass, making his left eye appear huge. He moves on to investigate the walls of the shrine, while the mayor is standing at the edge of the cliff, pointing down at something.  ] This is the footprint of the killer, Kyoshi. [  Sokka quickly squats beside the footprint to take a closer look at it.  ] It was at sunset, 370 years ago today, that she emerged from the temple, and struck down Chin the Great. After that tragic day, we built this statue to immortalize our great leader. [  They all look up at a statue of Chin the Great, who has a raised left hand in triumph.  ] Feel free to appreciate it.",25
Sokka,This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone. [  Runs back over to the statue.  ] And we know that the statue was built after Chin died.,25
Katara,"[  Excitedly drawing her conclusions.  ] So if they were built at the same time, that means–",25
Sokka,[  Shouting.  ] Shhh! I wanna solve it! [  Pointing at the temple.  ] That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple!,25
Katara,"That's a big hole in the mayor's story, [  Disappointed.  ] but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence.",25
Sokka,"You're right. [  Blows soap bubbles with his dragon shaped pipe, while thinking about their next course of action.  ] We need to go to Kyoshi Island.",25
Katara,[  Surprised.  ] Where did you get that?,25
Scary prisoner,"You got a bald head. [  Aang looks up in wonder to see who is talking. Switch to Aang's angle of view. A man is standing in the shadows, only his outline is visible.  ] Some nice tattoos. [  The man emerges from the shadows. He has a strong build, earrings in both ears, and his body has a large snake tattoo that covers the top of his chest and down his right arm. He suddenly charges Aang, letting out a load growl. He is stopped in his tracks by the chains around his neck. Aang slides down the wall in fear, while the man addresses him calmly.  ] You're going to fit in real well around here.",25
Koko,[  Angrily stamping her foot on the ground.  ] Where's Aangy?,25
Katara,"[  Gently breaks the news to Koko.  ] He couldn't be here, Koko.",25
Koko,[  Nagging.  ] I wanted to see Aangy ...,25
Katara,Oyaji! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life.,25
Sokka,They say it was Kyoshi.,25
Oyaji,[  Shocked.  ] Kyoshi? That's crazy talk! I'll take you to her shrine. Maybe something there will help you clear her name.,25
Sokka,"[  With feigned casualness.  ] So, uh ... what's Suki up to? Is she around?",25
Oyaji,"Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war. You kids had a big impact on Suki. She said you inspired her and she wanted to help change the world.",25
Sokka,"[  He disappointedly slants his eyes.  ] Oh, well ... that's great.",25
Oyaji,This temple was converted into a shrine to Kyoshi. The clerics tell us these relics are still connected to her spirit. That's her kimono.,25
Katara,[  Approvingly.  ] She had exquisite taste.,25
Oyaji,Please don't touch!,25
Sokka,"These fans ... [  He picks up one of the fans and waves it back and forth.  ] They were her weapons, no?",25
Oyaji,[  Sternly.  ] Also refrain from touching the fans.,25
Katara,[  Squatting beside a really big pair of brown boots.  ] These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!,25
Oyaji,[  Proudly.  ] The biggest of any Avatar.,25
Katara,[  Realizing something.  ] Wait a minute ... big feet? [  A flashback shows the much smaller footprint they saw at the edge of the cliff outside Chin Village.  ] Little footprint? [  She happily exclaims her findings.  ] There's no way–,25
Sokka,[  Annoyed.  ] Special outfit? Hat and pipe? These things mean anything to you?,25
Katara,[  Sarcastically.  ] You're right. I'm sorry. [  She bows slightly in a mocking gesture.  ] Please.,25
Sokka,[  Dramatically raises his hand in the air.  ] Aha! [  Showing his own boots to Oyaji.  ] There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint. [  Moves toward Katara to explain everything to her.  ] And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene.,25
Katara,"[  Unimpressed.  ] Brilliant, Sokka. [  Rolls her eyes.  ]",25
Scary prisoner,[  In a very friendly voice that does not stroke with his scary appearances.  ] This girl you're talking about? She'll come around. You just gotta hang in there.,25
Aang,[  Hopeful.  ] You think so?,25
Scary prisoner,Sure.,25
Prisoner #2,Yeah.,25
Sensitive ruffian,You're a catch.,25
Aang,[  Doubtful.  ] I don't know ...,25
Scary prisoner,"Hey! You're smart, handsome, funny. Not to mention you're the Avatar.",25
Aang,[  Smiling sincerely.  ] You guys are great.,25
Sensitive ruffian,[  Tears stream down his face while he talk in a very soft voice.  ] Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel. [  He dries his tears and sniffs.  ],25
Oyaji,"This piece is called ""The Birth of Kyoshi"". [  Sokka investigates the painting thoroughly.  ] It was painted at sunrise on this day this island was founded. Why, it was today in fact, three hundred and seventy years ago.",25
Sokka,"[  Sokka spins around in shock, spitting out some of the bubbles he swallowed. Very surprised.  ] Three hundred and seventy years? Wait, [  He grabs Oyaji by his collar.  ] are you sure it was today?",25
Oyaji,"Oh, seeing how it's Kyoshi Day, yes, [  He pulls himself free from Sokka's grasp and throws him back a little.  ] I'm sure.",25
Sokka,[  Staring at the painting again.  ] This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise. It took place at sun  set  . [  Addresses Katara.  ] Look at the shadows.,25
Katara,They point east. So the sun must have been in the west.,25
Oyaji,So what?,25
Sokka,"[  Shoves Katara out of the way as she yelps.  ] If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime. She has an alibi! [  Points his pipe dramatically toward the camera upon making his conclusion.  ]",25
Katara,"Honorable Mayor, we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar. We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence.",25
Tong,Evidence? [  Dismissive.  ] Hmph! That's not how our court system works.,25
Aang,Then how can I prove my innocence?,25
Tong,"Simple. I say what happened [  He points to himself, before pointing to Aang.  ], then you say what happened, and then I decide who's right. [  Everyone gasps at once, horrified by this news.  ] That's why we call it justice. Because it's ""just us.""",25
Tong,"[  Emotionally.  ] Everyone loved Chin the Great because he was so great. Then the Avatar showed up and killed him, and that's how it happened.",25
Guard,"[  Very deep, monotone voice.  ] The accused will now present its argument.",25
Sokka,"[  Raises his hand before his mouth to say some quiet, encouraging words.  ] You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence.",25
Aang,"[  Still tied up, unsure.  ] Right ... evidence. [  He shifts his eyes to the left while he is trying to remember what to say. Enthusiastically.  ] Ladies and gentlemen ... I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one. [  Raises his finger to count along but blanks out.  ] Uhhh ...",25
Sokka,[  Whispers.  ] The footprint!,25
Aang,"Oh, yeah. You see ... I have very large feet. [  The camera tilts down to reveal his small feet. The villagers are unimpressed by his argument.  ] Furthermore ... your temple matches your statue. [  The villagers look from one to the other, not knowing where Aang is going with this.  ] But ... I was in a painting at sunset. [  He quickly ends his exposition with a big smile.  ] So, there you have it, I'm not guilty.",25
Sokka,[  Mumbles to Katara while they continue to smile.  ] He's dead.,25
Iroh,"Looks like you did some serious shopping. [  He picks up a big, gold-colored teapot.  ] But where did you get the money?",25
Zuko,[  Lazily resting against a tree trunk.  ] Do you like your new teapot?,25
Iroh,"To be honest with you [  He puts the pot down.  ], the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup. [  Iroh walks over to Zuko and squats down beside him.  ] I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by. [  Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder who closes his eyes as if he was holding something back.  ] But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.",25
Zuko,There's no honor for me without the Avatar.,25
Iroh,"Zuko ... [  Sighs.  ] Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now.",25
Zuko,[  Turns away from his uncle.  ] Then there is no hope at all.,25
Iroh,"No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. [  Zuko bows his head as he listens to his uncle's wisdom.  ] In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.",25
Katara,"Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony.",25
Tong,"I've already told you, it's just me and the accused. You can't call any witnesses!",25
Katara,This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call ... [  Spreads her arms.  ] Avatar Kyoshi herself!,25
Sokka,[  Whispering.  ] What are you doing?,25
Katara,"[  Hopeful.  ] Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something.",25
Sokka,[  Plays with his magnifying glass.  ] I do believe in the power of stuff.,25
Tong,[  Angry.  ] This is a mockery of Chin Law!,25
Katara,"[  Pleading.  ] Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here!",25
Aang,"[  Higher pitch.  ] Hey, everybody! Avatar Kyoshi here. [  Rapidly blinks his eyes.  ]",25
Tong,"[  Walking over to Aang.  ] This is ridiculous! [  Points at Aang while he addresses the audience.  ] For the murder of Chin the Great, this court finds the Avatar–",25
Kyoshi,"I killed Chin the Conqueror. [  A flashback shows how Chin earthbends an earth column beneath one of his subjects as he was offering something to Chin. Voice-over.  ] A horrible tyrant, Chin was expanding his army to all corners of the continent.",25
Kyoshi,"When they came to the neck of the peninsula where we lived, he demanded our immediate surrender. [  Kyoshi calmly walks toward him to face his challenge.  ] I warned him that I would not sit passively while he took our home. But he did not back down.",25
Kyoshi,"On that day, we split from the mainland.",25
Kyoshi,I created Kyoshi Island so my people could be safe from invaders.,25
Aang,"[  Confused.  ] So, what just happened?",25
Katara,[  Awkwardly.  ] Uhhh ... you kind of confessed. Sorry.,25
Tong,[  Standing up in the background.  ] And I find you ... [  He brushes himself off and points at Aang.  ] Guilty! Bring out the Wheel of Punishment!,25
Zuko,Uncle ... [  Switch to a close-up of Iroh with Zuko on the background.  ] I thought a lot about what you said.,25
Iroh,"[  Iroh's sad expression clears up as he hears Zuko talk.  ] You did? Good, good.",25
Zuko,It's helped me realize something. We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together. [  Iroh's brightened expression quickly disappears again.  ] I need to find my own way.,25
Iroh,[  Calling after Zuko.  ] Wait!,25
Guard,"[  Deep, monotonous voice.  ] The accused will now spin the Wheel of Punishment to determine his sentence.",25
Aang,"I said I would face justice, so I will.",25
Villager,"[  Hoping.  ] Come on, torture machine!",25
Villager #2,Eaten by bears!,25
Villager #3,Razor pit!,25
Katara,[  Begging.  ] Community service! Please stop on community service!,25
Guard,"[  Monotone.  ] Looks like it's ""boiled in oil.""",25
Mongke,"We've come to claim this village for the Fire Lord! [  Close-up.  ] Now show me your leader so I may ... [  Kahchi swings his Guan Dao back and forth, slicing through the statue of Chin the Great. While it crumbles down, Mongke continues with a grin.  ] dethrone him!",25
Villager,That's him over there!,25
Tong,"Ahhh! [  Commanding.  ] You, Avatar, do something!",25
Aang,"[  Apathetically.  ] Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil.",25
Tong,"There, community service! Now serve our community and get rid of those rhinos!",25
Mongke,"[  Raising his hand while shouting his command.  ] Rough Rhinos, to the town!",25
Sokka,[  Raises his arms in the air and exclaims ecstatically.  ] Boomerang! You do always come back!,25
Tong,"From now on, we'll celebrate a new Avatar Day in honor of the day Avatar Aang [  Camera pans down to show Katara, Aang, and Sokka, each holding a bowl and grinning happily.  ] saved us from the Rough Rhino Invasion.",25
Sokka,[  Looks questioningly into his bowl.  ] What is this?,25
Tong,That's our new festival food! Un-fried dough. May we eat it and be reminded of how on this day the Avatar was not boiled in oil.,25
Katara,"Happy Avatar Day, everyone!",25
Sokka,[  Stares skeptically at his dough-cookie.  ] This is by far the worst town we've ever been to.,25
Sokka,[  Pensively.  ] It's pricey ... but I really do like it.,26
Katara,"Then you should get it, you deserve something nice.",26
Sokka,"I do, don't I? [  Katara looks at him with a bored expression.  ] But no, it's too expensive. I shouldn't.",26
Katara,"All right, then don't.",26
Sokka,[  Enthusiastically.  ] You know what? I'm gonna get it. [  Smiles in a pleased way.  ],26
Flyer distribution man,"Psst, psst! Hey, you kids love earthbending? You like ... throwing rocks? Then check out Master Yu's Earthbending Academy.",26
Aang,Look! There's a coupon on the back! The first lesson is free.,26
Katara,Who knows? This Master Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking for.,26
Yu,"Take your stances! [  His students take their fighting stances, except for Aang.  ] Now, strike as if you're punching through your opponent's head!",26
Yu,"[  Approaches Aang.  ] So, are you ready to commit to more lessons? If you pay for the whole year in advance, I'll bump you up to the next belt!",26
Aang,"Ehhh, he's not the one. [  Beats his right ear, causing sand to fall out of his left ear.  ]",26
Male student,"[  Leaves the Earthbending Academy, accompanied by another student.  ] I think The Boulder's going to win back the belt at Earth Rumble VI.",26
Male student #2,He's going to have to fight his way through the best earthbenders in the world to get a shot at the champ.,26
Aang,"Excuse me, but where is this earthbending tournament, exactly?",26
Male student,"[  Sarcastically.  ] It's on the island of Noneya ... ""Noneya"" business!",26
Sokka,"[  Laughs and wipes tears of laughter away.  ] Oh, I got to remember that one!",26
Katara,"[  Consolingly to Aang.  ] I'll take care of this. [  To the students.  ] Hey, strong guys! Wait up! [  Runs after the students around a corner.  ]",26
Sokka,"[  Looking at his bag, holding it out.  ] What was I thinking? [  Angrily to Aang.  ] I don't need a new bag! Why did you let me buy this?",26
Katara,You ready to find an earthbending teacher? Because we're going to Earth Rumble VI!,26
Aang,[  Looks surprised.  ] How'd you get them to tell you?,26
Katara,Oh ... a girl has her ways. [  Smiles.  ],26
Aang,"Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here.",26
Sokka,I guess that's why.,26
Xin Fu,"[  Raises his left arm.  ] Welcome to Earth Rumble VI! I am your host, Xin Fu!",26
Katara,"[  Sighs and looks the other way.  ] This is just going to be a bunch of guys chucking rocks at each other, isn't it?",26
Sokka,[  Happily.  ] That's what I paid for.,26
Xin Fu,"The rules are simple. Just knock the other guy out of the ring, and you win! [  Leaps up to a podium above the ring. A bell rings.  ] Round one: The Boulder vs. The Big Bad Hippo! [  While Xin Fu speaks, The Boulder raises his arms and turns around to the cheering of the audience. The Hippo roars.  ]",26
The Boulder,"[  Pointing at The Hippo.  ] Listen up, Hippo. You may be big, but you ain't bad! [  Grinning insanely.  ] The Boulder's gonna win this in a landslide!",26
The Hippo,Hippo ... mad!,26
Xin Fu,"Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! The Hippo is rocking the boat!",26
Xin Fu,The Boulder wins!,26
Katara,[  Looking at The Boulder.  ] How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves.,26
Aang,"[  Shrugs.  ] I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka?",26
Xin Fu,Next match ... The Boulder versus [  Cut to to a close-up of Fire Nation Man happily waving a Fire Nation flag; voice-over.  ] Fire Nation Man!,26
Fire Nation Man,"[  With a pseudo-Russian accent.  ] Please, to rise for Fire Nation national anthem! [  Put his left hand over his heart; begins to sing.  ] Fire Lord, my flame burns [  Drops to his right knee and stretches out his left arm.  ] for thee!",26
Sokka,[  Yelling.  ] Go back to the Fire Nation!,26
Fire Nation Man,"No, no, please!",26
Sokka,Yeah! Wooo! [  Points at Fire Nation Man.  ] The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt! [  Close-up of Sokka as he continues to cheer and make taunting faces.  ] Yeah! Woohoo!,26
Xin Fu,"Now, the moment [  The light slowly dims to put him in the spotlight.  ] you've all been waiting for. The Boulder versus [  Cut to a shot of a person with black hair mostly obscured by a green prize belt; voice-over.  ] your champion ... the Blind Bandit!",26
Katara,"She can't really be blind. [  Turn her head and squints her eyes skeptically.  ] It's just part of her [  Cut to a close-up of the Bandit's milky-green eyes; pans right.  ] character, right?",26
Aang,[  Frontal shot.  ] I think she is.,26
Sokka,"[  Camera moves back to include Sokka in the shot; deadpanned.  ] I think she is ... [  Shouting, gesturing downward with both hands.  ] going down!",26
The Boulder,The Boulder feels conflicted about fighting a young blind girl.,26
Toph,"[  Points at The Boulder. Mockingly.  ] Sounds to me like you're [  Goes into a mockingly scared position.  ] scared, Boulder!",26
The Boulder,"[  After a pause where he looks stunned.  ] The Boulder's over his conflicted feelings, [  Narrows his eyes.  ] and now he's ready to bury you screen [  Expands instantly and the Boulder makes a dramatic, crushing gesture.  ] in a rock-alanche!",26
Toph,"Whenever you're ready, The Pebble! [  Throws her head back and laughs.  ]",26
The Boulder,It's on!,26
The Boulder,[  Painfully.  ] Ooooooh!,26
Xin Fu,"Your winner, and still the champion, [  Cut to a wider shot of the Bandit, who raises her right fist in victory.  ] the Blind Bandit!",26
Katara,How did she do that?,26
Aang,She waited ... and listened.,26
Xin Fu,"To make things a little more interesting, I'm offering up this sack of gold pieces to anyone who can defeat [  He motions toward the champion.  ] the Blind Bandit! [  He motions toward Toph once again. Silence.  ] What? No one dares to face her?",26
Aang,I will!,26
Sokka,Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder!,26
Toph,Do people really want to see  two  little girls fighting out here?,26
Audience,Oooh.,26
Aang,[  Aang puts his hands up in a conciliatory gesture.  ] I don't really want to fight you. I want to talk to you.,26
Sokka,Boo! No [  Katara turns to her brother with a look of disapproval.  ] talking!,26
Katara,[  Slaps Sokka.  ] Don't boo at him!,26
Toph,"Somebody's a little light on his feet! What's your fighting name: [  Cut to Aang.  ] the Fancy Dancer? [  Aang grins sheepishly before Toph launches another pillar, which lifts him up.  ] Where'd you go?",26
Aang,"Please, wait!",26
Toph,There you are!,26
Aang,"[  Going after her.  ] Please, listen! I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you!",26
Toph,"[  Angrily.  ] Whoever you are, just leave me alone.",26
Aang,Wait!,26
Sokka,"[  Gets the belt and gold.  ] Way to go, champ!",26
Sokka,"I've got to admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag. It matches the belt, perfectly.",26
Katara,[  Sarcastically.  ] That is a big relief.,26
Aang,"If we want to find the Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a great place to start.",26
Male student,"Oh great, you again.",26
Katara,"[  Glares at them, causing them to back off.  ] Yeah, I didn't think so.",26
Sokka,[  Smugly.  ] Nicely done.,26
Male student,Hey! You're that kid who beat the Blind Bandit!,26
Aang,We need to talk to her. Do you guys know where she lives?,26
Male student,"The Blind Bandit's a mystery. [  Raises fist dramatically.  ] She shows up to fight, then disappears.",26
Katara,[  Lays hands on Aang's shoulder.  ] Let me handle this. [  Approaches the second student with a stern look; says accusingly.  ] You're not telling us everything!,26
Male student #2,"[  Holds hand up defensively.  ] No, no, I-I swear it's true. No one knows where she goes, or who she really is.",26
Aang,"That's because we're asking about the wrong person. In my vision, I saw a girl, in a white dress, with a pet flying boar. Know anybody like that?",26
Male student,"Well, a flying boar is the symbol of the Beifong family. They're the richest people in town. Probably the whole world.",26
Male student #2,"Yeah, but they don't have a daughter.",26
Aang,A flying boar is good enough for me. Let's check it out.,26
Male student,"[  Quietly.  ] Yeah, you better leave.",26
Katara,"Hey, I got my eye on you.",26
Sokka,[  States coolly.  ] Water Tribe.,26
The Boulder,"I'm telling you, The Boulder was standing right there. I saw the kid strike, but there was no earthbending. Nothing made contact. The Blind Bandit just fell out of the ring. She must've took a dive and split the money with the kid.",26
Xin Fu,"[  Slams the wall, causing rocks to land on his feet; cries out in anger and pain.  ] Nobody cheats Xin Fu.",26
Aang,That's the flying boar from my vision. Come on!,26
Toph,"What are you doing here, Twinkle Toes?!",26
Aang,How did you know it was me?,26
Sokka,"Don't answer to Twinkle Toes, it's not manly!",26
Katara,You're the one whose bag matches his belt.,26
Toph,How did you find me?,26
Aang,"Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth. And then I had a vision in a magic swamp, [  Toph raises her eye in disbelief.  ] and -",26
Katara,"[  Cutting off Aang.  ] What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar. And if he doesn't master earthbending soon, he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord.",26
Toph,"Not my problem. Now, [  Begins walking away.  ] get out of here, or I'll call the guards.",26
Sokka,"Look, we all have to do our part to win this war, and yours is to teach Aang earthbending.",26
Toph,"Guards! Guards, help!",26
Guard,"Toph, what happened?",26
Toph,I ... thought I heard someone. I got scared.,26
Guard,"You know your father doesn't want you wandering the grounds without supervision, Toph.",26
Lao,[  Takes a sip of tea.  ] I'm pleased to hear that Toph's private lessons are going well. But I want to be sure she's not trying anything too dangerous.,26
Yu,Absolutely not. I am keeping her at a beginner's level. Basic forms and breathing exercises only.,26
Lao,Very good. [  A servant comes in.  ],26
Servant,"Excuse me, sir, but you have a visitor.",26
Lao,Who thinks they are so important they can just come to my home unannounced?,26
Servant,"Uh ... the Avatar, sir. [  Toph's eyes widen in shock and surprise.  ]",26
Lao,Blow on it. It's too hot for her.,26
Aang,Allow me. [  Sends a small tornado at the cup. Everyone claps.  ],26
Poppy,"Avatar Aang, it's an honor to have you visit us.",26
Lao,"In your opinion, how much longer do think the war will last?",26
Aang,"I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but I can't do that without finding an earthbending teacher first. [  Close-up of Toph with a annoyed look.  ]",26
Lao,"[  Chuckles.  ] Well, Master Yu is the finest teacher in the land. [  The camera pans to Yu.  ] He's been teaching Toph since she was little.",26
Aang,Then she must be a great earthbender! Probably good enough to teach someone else! [  Toph sends a fissure under the table at him.  ] Ow!,26
Yu,Toph is still learning the basics.,26
Lao,"Yes, and sadly, because of her blindness, I don't think she will ever become a true master.",26
Aang,"Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is.",26
Toph,[  Angrily.  ] What's your problem?!,26
Aang,[  Just as angrily.  ] What's  your  problem?,26
Poppy,"Well, shall we move to the living room for dessert, then?",26
Aang,"Good night, buddy.",26
Toph,"Relax. Look, I'm sorry about dinner. Let's call a truce, okay? [  Aang lets down his defensive position and the two head out to the yard. Toph walks along the side of a bridge.  ] Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing. [  Jumps down.  ] I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet. I feel the vibrations in the Earth, and I can see where everything is. [  The camera shows an aerial view.  ] You, that tree ... [  Cut back to the ground.  ] even those ants.",26
Aang,[  Looks around.  ] That's amazing.,26
Toph,My parents don't understand. They've always treated me like I was helpless.,26
Aang,Is that why you became the Blind Bandit?,26
Toph,Yeah.,26
Aang,Then why stay here where you're not happy?,26
Toph,They're my parents. Where else am I supposed to go?,26
Aang,You could come with us.,26
Toph,"Yeah. You guys get to go wherever you want. No one telling you what to do, that's the life. It's just not my life. [  She detects something and touches the ground.  ] We're being ambushed!",26
Xin Fu,I think you kids owe me some money.,26
Sokka,Whoever took Aang and Toph left this. [  Hands the note to Katara.  ],26
Katara,"""If you want to see your daughter again, bring five hundred gold pieces to the arena."" It's signed Xin Fu and The Boulder.",26
Sokka,[  Serious.  ] I can't believe it ... [  Grabs the note much to Katara's surprise and runs off a few feet. Cut to a further off shot; enthusiastically.  ] I have The Boulder's autograph!,26
Lao,"Master Yu, I need you to help me get my daughter back.",26
Katara,We're going with you.,26
Poppy,"Poor Toph, she must be so scared ...",26
Toph,You think you're so tough? [  The camera zooms back to show her case and Aang's suspended from chains. She points somewhere below her.  ] Why don't you come up here so I can snap that grin off your face? [  Cut to Xin Fu and The Boulder looking from below them on the floor of the arena.  ],26
Xin Fu,[  Narrows his eyes. Dryly.  ] I'm not smiling.,26
Lao,Toph!,26
Sokka,Here's your money. [  Sets the bag of gold on the ground.  ] Now let them go.,26
Katara,What about Aang?,26
Xin Fu,"[  Showing the Fire Nation wanted poster.  ] I think the Fire Nation will pay a hefty price for the Avatar. Now, get out of my ring.",26
Aang,"Go, I'll be okay.",26
Katara,"Toph, there's too many of them. We need an earthbender. We need you!",26
Lao,My daughter is blind. She is blind and tiny and helpless and fragile. She cannot help you!,26
Toph,"Yes, I can.",26
Toph,Let him go! I beat you all before and I'll do it again!,26
The Boulder,The Boulder takes issue with that comment.,26
Toph,Wait! [  Listens to their vibrations as they run toward her; turns head to Sokka.  ] They're mine.,26
Aang,Hit it harder!,26
Sokka,I'm trying!,26
Yu,I never knew. Your daughter's amazing!,26
Yu,She's the greatest earthbender I've ever seen.,26
Toph,"Dad, I know it's probably hard for you to see me this way. But the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me. I love fighting. I love being an earthbender, and I'm really, really good at it. I know I've kept my life secret from you, but you were keeping me secret from the whole world. You were doing it to protect me, but I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend. So, now that you see who I really am, I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me.",26
Lao,"Of course it doesn't change the way I feel about you, Toph. It's made me realize something.",26
Toph,It has?,26
Lao,Yes. I've let you had far too much freedom. From now on you'll be cared for and guarded twenty-four hours a day.,26
Toph,"But, Dad!",26
Poppy,"We're doing this for your own good, Toph.",26
Lao,Please escort the Avatar and his friends out. They are no longer welcome here.,26
Aang,"I'm sorry, Toph.",26
Toph,"I'm sorry too. Goodbye, Aang. [  She sheds a tear.  ]",26
Katara,"Don't worry, we'll find you a teacher. There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there.",26
Aang,[  Cut to a wider shot from behind them. The full moon shines in the distance.  ] Not like her.,26
Aang,Toph! What are you doing here?,26
Toph,"My dad changed his mind. He said I was free to travel the world. [  Katara and Sokka look at each other with unsure looks, but smile at Toph.  ]",26
Sokka,"Well, we'd better get out of here, before your dad changes his mind again.",26
Toph,Good idea.,26
Aang,"You're going to be a great teacher, Toph.",26
Toph,"Speaking of which, I want to show you something.",26
Aang,Okay.,26
Toph,"Now we're even. Um, I'll take the belt back.",26
Toph,Ow! [  Cut to a wide shot Appa and Toph still laid out flat.  ],26
Sokka,Sorry.,26
Lao,I know you two are very different. But I believe you have a common interest. [  A servant brings out a chest of gold. Xin Fu and Yu exchange glances at one another.  ] The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter. I want you to do whatever it takes to bring her home.,26
Earth Kingdom soldier,"Come on, spidersnake eyes! [  He rolls a pair of dice and they land with two fives, face-up.  ] Ha! Ha! Yeah!",27
Zuko,"Could I get some water, a bag of feed and something hot to eat? [  Zuko holds out his hand. In it are two coins.  ]",27
Store owner,Not enough here for a hot meal. I can get you  two  bags of feed.,27
Earth Kingdom soldier,Ow!,27
Gow,"Hey! You throwing eggs at us, stranger?",27
Zuko,No.,27
Gow,You see who did throw it?,27
Zuko,[  Turns to face them.  ] No.,27
Earth Kingdom soldier,"That your favorite word, no?",27
Gow,Egg had to come from somewhere.,27
Zuko,[  Turns around.  ] Maybe a chicken flew over.,27
Gow,"Thanks for your contribution. The army appreciates your support. [  He throws the bags to one of his fellow soldiers.  ] You better leave town. Penalty for stayin's a lot steeper than you can afford, stranger. Trust me. [  He pats his hammer at his side menacingly.  ]",27
Store owner,Those soldiers are supposed to protect us from the Fire Nation. But they're just a bunch of thugs.,27
Lee,Thanks for not ratting me out!,27
Lee,"I'll take you to my house and feed your ostrich horse for you. Come on, I owe you! [  Lee leads the way, pulling along the animal.  ]",27
Lee,No one can ever sneak up on us.,27
Zuko,No kidding.,27
Gansu,You a friend of Lee's?,27
Lee,"This guy just stood up to the soldiers! By the end, he practically had them running away!",27
Sela,Does this guy have a name?,27
Zuko,[  Nervously.  ] I'm ... uh ...,27
Gansu,"[  Off-camera.  ] He doesn't have to say who he is if he doesn't want to, Sela. [  Cuts to shot of him standing with his family.  ] Anyone who can hold his own against those bully soldiers is welcome here. Those men should be ashamed to wear Earth Kingdom uniforms.",27
Sela,"The real soldiers are off fighting the War, [  Cuts to shot of Lee.  ] like Lee's big brother Sensu. [  Pause.  ] Supper's going to be ready soon. Would you like to stay?",27
Zuko,I can't. I should be moving on. [  The wife frowns and casts a glance at her husband.  ],27
Sela,"Gansu could use some help on the barn. Why don't you two work for a while, and then we'll eat.",27
Lee,You don't seem like you're from around here.,27
Zuko,[  Shaking his head.  ] Mm-mm.,27
Lee,Where are you from then?,27
Zuko,[  Lowers his hammer.  ] Far away.,27
Lee,Ohhh. Where are you going?,27
Gansu,"Lee, give it a rest. Stop asking the man personal questions, got it?",27
Lee,[  Disappointed and rests his head on his arm. He sighs.  ] Yes. [  Pause.  ] So how'd you get that scar?,27
Gansu,It's not nice to bother people about things they might not want to talk about. A man's past is his business.,27
Young Zuko,"Hey Mom, want to see how Azula feeds turtle ducks? [  Zuko throws the rest of the loaf of bread into the water and hits one of the baby turtle ducks. Ursa is shocked.  ]",27
Ursa,Zuko! Why would you do that?,27
Young Zuko,"Ow! Ow ow! Ouch! [  Ursa removes the turtle duck from Zuko and gently throws her back into the pond, where she swims off with her babies. Zuko is pouting.  ]",27
Young Zuko,Stupid turtle duck. Why she'd do that?,27
Ursa,"Zuko. That's what moms are like. [  Puts her arm around Zuko.  ] If you mess with their babies,[  She playfully bites behind Zuko's ear.  ], they're gonna bite you back! [  They laugh.  ]",27
Young Ty Lee,Ugh! Azula!,27
Young Azula,[  Whispering in Ty Lee's ear as her friend giggles.  ] Watch this! [  Runs toward her mother and Zuko.  ] Mom! Can you make Zuko play with us? We need equal teams to play a game!,27
Young Zuko,I am  not  cart-wheeling.,27
Young Azula,"You won't have to. [  Rolls her eyes.  ] Cart-wheeling's not a game, dum-dum.",27
Young Zuko,I don't care. I don't want to play with you!,27
Young Azula,"We  are  brother and sister. It's important for us to spend time together! Don't you think so, Mom? [  Shoots her mother an innocent smile.  ]",27
Ursa,"[  Places her hands on Zuko's shoulder.  ] Yes, darling, I think it's a good idea to play with your sister. [  Ruffles his hair.  ] Go on now, just for a little while. [  Walks away, with Zuko glaring at his sister.  ]",27
Young Azula,"[  Off-camera.  ] Here's the way it goes. [  After placing apple on Mai's head, she runs back several feet.  ] Now what you do is, try to knock the apple off the other person's head, like this. [  Azula shots a small jet of flame to the apple with her firebending and knowingly sets it on fire.  ]",27
Young Azula,"[  Lays a hand on Ty Lee's shoulder.  ] See, I told you it would work!",27
Young Ty Lee,"Aww, they're so cute together!",27
Young Mai,You two are such ... ugh!,27
Ursa,"I was just coming to get you. Uncle Iroh sent us a letter from the war-front. [  Zuko stomps past her, leaving small puddles behind him as he goes.  ] You're soaking wet?",27
Young Zuko,[  Raises hands in frustration.  ] Girls are crazy!,27
Iroh,"[  Voice-over.  ] If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold. I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first! [  Laughs.  ]",27
Ursa,"Until then, enjoy these gifts.",27
Ursa,"For Zuko, a pearl dagger from the general who surrendered when we broke through the Outer Wall. Note the inscription and the superior craftsmanship.",27
Young Zuko,"[  Zuko picks up the dagger admiringly, unsheathes it and reads the inscription.  ] Never give up without a fight.",27
Ursa,"And for Azula, a new friend. She wears the latest fashion for Earth Kingdom girls.",27
Young Azula,"If Uncle doesn't make it back from war, then Dad will be next in line for Fire Lord, wouldn't he?",27
Ursa,"Azula, we don't speak that way. It would be awful if Uncle Iroh didn't return. And besides, Fire Lord Azulon is a picture of health.",27
Young Zuko,How would you like it if cousin Lu Ten wanted Dad to die?,27
Young Azula,I still think our dad would make a much better Fire Lord than His Royal Tea-Loving Kookiness. [  Sets the doll's head on fire.  ],27
Zuko,You're holding them wrong.,27
Zuko,"Keep in mind, these are dual swords. Two halves of a single weapon. Don't think of them as separate, 'cause they're not. They're just two different parts of the same whole.",27
Lee,I think you'd really like my brother Sensu. He used to show me stuff like this all the time.,27
Sela,[  Reaches up and offers Zuko a package.  ] Here. This ought to get you through a few meals.,27
Gansu,What do you think they want?,27
Zuko,Trouble.,27
Gansu,"What do you want, Gow?",27
Gow,Just thought someone ought to tell you that your son's battalion got captured. [  To his fellow soldiers.  ] You boys hear what the Fire Nation did with their last group of Earth Kingdom prisoners?,27
Earth Kingdom soldier,"Dressed 'em up in Fire Nation uniforms and put 'em on the front line unarmed, the way I heard it. [  Spits on the ground.  ] Then they just watched.",27
Gansu,[  Angrily.  ] You watch your mouth!,27
Gow,Why bother rooting around in the mud with these pigs?,27
Ursa,Iroh has lost his son. Your cousin Lu Ten did not survive the battle.,27
Lee,What's going to happen to my brother?,27
Gansu,I'm going to the front. I'm going to find Sensu and bring him back.,27
Lee,When my dad goes ... will you stay?,27
Zuko,No. I need to move on.,27
Zuko,Here. I want you to have this. Read the inscription.,27
Lee,[  Unsheathes the dagger.  ] Made in Earth Kingdom.,27
Zuko,The other one.,27
Lee,Never give up without a fight.,27
Young Azula,You waste all your time playing with knives. You're not even good!,27
Young Zuko,Put an apple on your head and we'll find out how good I am!,27
Young Azula,"By the way, Uncle's coming home.",27
Young Zuko,Does that mean ... we won the War?,27
Young Azula,"No, it means Uncle's a quitter  and  a loser.",27
Young Zuko,What are you talking about? Uncle's  not  a quitter!,27
Young Azula,"Oh yes he is! He found out his son died and he just fell apart! A real general would stay and burn Ba Sing Se to the ground, not lose the battle and come home crying.",27
Young Zuko,How do you know what he should do? He's probably just sad his only kid is gone. Forever.,27
Ursa,"Your father has requested an audience with Fire Lord Azulon. Best clothes, hurry up!",27
Young Azula,[  In a bored tone.  ] Fire Lord Azulon ... can't you just call him 'Grandfather'? He's not exactly the powerful Fire Lord he used to be. Someone will probably end up taking his place soon.,27
Ursa,[  Angrily.  ] Young lady! Not another word!,27
Ursa,What is wrong with that child?,27
Ozai,And how was it Great-Grandfather Sozin managed to win the Battle of Han Tui?,27
Young Zuko,[  Confusedly.  ] Great-Grandfather won ... because ...,27
Young Azula,"Because even though his army was outnumbered, he cleverly calculated his advantages. The enemy was downwind and there was a drought. Their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes.",27
Ozai,"Correct, my dear. Now, would you show Grandfather the new moves you demonstrated to me?",27
Ozai,She's a true prodigy! Just like her grandfather for whom she's named.,27
Young Azula,"[  Sits back down, and looks at Zuko out of the corner of her eye and whispers.  ] You'll never catch up ...",27
Young Zuko,[  Stands up angrily.  ] I'd like to demonstrate what I've been learning.,27
Young Zuko,I failed.,27
Ursa,"No. I loved watching you. That's who you are, Zuko. Someone who keeps fighting even though it's hard.",27
Azulon,"Prince Ozai, why are you wasting my time with this pomp? Just tell me what you want. Everyone else, go!",27
Young Zuko,What are you -?,27
Young Azula,Shh!,27
Ozai,"Father, you must have realized as I have, that with Lu Ten gone, Iroh's bloodline has ended. After his son's death, my brother abandoned the siege at Ba Sing Se, and who knows when he will return home. But I am here, Father, and my children are alive.",27
Azulon,Say what it is you want!,27
Ozai,"Father, revoke Iroh's birthright. I am your humble servant, here to serve you and our nation. Use me.",27
Azulon,You dare suggest I betray Iroh? My first born? Directly after the demise of his only beloved son? I think Iroh has suffered enough! But you ... your punishment has scarcely begun!,27
Young Azula,"[  Sing-songy.  ] Dad's going to kill you! [  Seriously.  ] Really, he is.",27
Young Zuko,"Ha-ha, Azula. Nice try.",27
Young Azula,"Fine, don't believe me. But I heard everything. Grandfather said Dad's punishment should fit his crime. [  Imitates Azulon.  ] ""You must know the pain of losing a first-born son. By sacrificing your own!""",27
Young Zuko,Liar!,27
Young Azula,I'm only telling you for your own good. I know! Maybe you could find a nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you!,27
Young Zuko,Stop it! You're lying! Dad would never do that to me!,27
Ursa,Your father would never do what to you? What is going on here?,27
Young Azula,I don't know ...,27
Ursa,It's time for a talk!,27
Young Zuko,[  Chanting in a low voice.  ] Azula always lies. Azula always lies.,27
Zuko,Azula always lies.,27
Sela,"You have to help! It's Lee – the thugs from town came back as soon as Gansu left. When they ordered us to give them food, Lee pulled a knife on them! I don't even know where he got a knife! Then they took him away. [  Begins to sob.  ] They told me if he's old enough to fight, he's old enough to join the army. I know we barely know you, but ...",27
Zuko,[  Stands up dramatically.  ] I'll get your son back.,27
Lee,Hey! There he is! I told you he'd come!,27
Zuko,Let the kid go.,27
Gow,"[  Laughs loudly, but quickly regains composure.  ] Who do you think you are, telling us what to do?",27
Zuko,"It doesn't matter who I am. But I know who you are. You're not soldiers; you're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power. Mostly over women and kids. You don't want Lee in your army – you're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to the war.",27
Gow,[  To a fellow soldier.  ] Are you gonna let this stranger stand there and insult you like this?,27
Old man,Give him a left! A left!,27
Old woman,It's not a fistfight ...,27
Old man,"He's got a left sword, don't he?",27
Old man,Look out!,27
Lee,Behind you!,27
Young Zuko,... Mom?,27
Ursa,"Zuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done, I've done to protect you.",27
Ursa,"Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are.",27
Lee,[  Whispers worriedly.  ] Get up ...!,27
Gow,Who ... who are you?,27
Zuko,"My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. Prince of the Fire Nation, and heir to the throne.",27
Old man,"Liar! I heard of you! You're not a prince, you're an outcast! His own father burned and disowned him!",27
Sela,Not a step closer.,27
Zuko,"[  Zuko kneels down in front of Sela, with Lee peeking around his mother's back, offering the knife.  ] It's yours. You should have it.",27
Lee,No! I hate you!,27
Young Zuko,Mom? [  Zuko leaps out of bed and runs out of his room down the hallway.  ] Mom? Mom!,27
Young Zuko,Where's Mom?,27
Young Azula,"No one knows. Oh, and last night, Grandpa passed away.",27
Young Zuko,"Not funny, Azula! You're sick. And I want my knife back, now. [  Zuko tries to grab it, but misses as Azula quickly moves out of the way, and loudly grunts.  ]",27
Young Azula,[  Tauntingly.  ] Who's going to make me?  Mom?,27
Young Zuko,Where is she?,27
Fire Sage,"Azulon. Fire Lord to our nation for twenty-three years. You were our fearless leader in the Battle of Garsai. Our matchless conqueror of the Hu Xin Provinces. You were father of Iroh, father of Ozai, husband of Ilah, now passed. Grandfather of Lu Ten, now passed. Grandfather of Zuko, and Azula. We lay you to rest.",27
Fire Sage,"As was your dying wish, you are now succeeded by your second son.",27
Fire Sage,Hail Fire Lord Ozai!,27
Toph,Hey! You guys picked a great campsite. [  This directs everyone's attention to her. She wriggles her toes in the thick mat of fur covering the ground around the bison.  ] The grass is so soft.,28
Sokka,That's not grass. [  Somewhat displeased.  ] Appa's shedding.,28
Katara,"[  Displeased, raises foot warily.  ] Oh, gross!",28
Aang,"[  Cheerfully.  ] That's not gross, it's just a part of spring! You know, rebirth, flowers blooming and Appa gets a new coat.",28
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Ah, the beauty of spring.",28
Katara,"[  Waving arms about, now coated in fur.  ] Stop! Appa, stop! Ugh! [  Coughs.  ]",28
Sokka,"[  Bending over, his back turned to her.  ] It's not that bad, Katara. [  He turns to reveal a wig made of fur, done up in a towering beehive.  ] It makes a great wig!",28
Aang,[  Wearing a beard of fur.  ] And a great beard! [  Aang and Sokka laugh while pointing at each other.  ],28
Katara,"[  Wiping fur off her clothing with her eyes closed.  ] I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group, because you two are disgusting.",28
Toph,"[  Walking up from behind the two boys.  ] Excuse me, does anyone have a razor? Because I've got some hairy pits!",28
Katara,"So Toph, usually when setting up camp, we try to divide up the work.",28
Toph,"[  Shrugging casually.  ] Hey, don't worry about me. I'm good to go.",28
Katara,"Well, actually what I'm trying to say is, [  Holds arms out in gesture.  ] some of us might fetch water, while someone else might set up the fire pit, or put up the tent. [  Momo flies over to her, dropping several berries he had collected into her hands.  ] Even Momo does his fair share.",28
Toph,"[  Breezily.  ] Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I don't need a fire, [  Pats bag.  ] I've already collected my own food and look, [  Earthbends a rock tent over her.  ] my tent's all set up.",28
Katara,"[  Slightly irritated.  ] Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish -",28
Toph,[  Angered.  ] I don't understand what's the problem here!,28
Katara,[  Waves her hand dismissively and walks away.  ] Never mind.,28
Aang,[  Landing onto the ground to aid Sokka.  ] Sorry!,28
Katara,"[  Rubs back of head sheepishly.  ] Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each other's nerves.",28
Toph,"[  Casually.  ] Yeah, you  do  seem pretty tired.",28
Katara,[  Growing disgusted.  ] I meant all of us.,28
Toph,"Well, good night.",28
Katara,[  Slightly irked.  ] Good night.,28
Toph,There's something coming toward us!,28
Aang,What is it?,28
Toph,"[  Pressing hand to the ground.  ] It feels like an avalanche, but also  not  an avalanche.",28
Sokka,[  Sarcastically.  ] Your powers of perception are frightening.,28
Katara,Should we leave?,28
Aang,Better safe than sorry.,28
Katara,What is that thing?,28
Toph,"[  Leaping off Appa and lying on the ground, relieved.  ] Ah, land sweet land! [  Rises and says cheerfully.  ] See you guys in the morning!",28
Katara,"Actually, can you help us unload?",28
Toph,[  Sarcastically.  ] Really? You need  me  to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?,28
Katara,"[  Curtly.  ] Well, yeah. That and everything else. You're a part of our team now, and -",28
Toph,[  Points a finger at Katara in irritation.  ] Look! I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff! [  Turns and begins walking away.  ] I'm carrying my own weight.,28
Katara,"[  Angrily.  ] That's not the point. [  Approaches Toph.  ] Ever since you joined us, you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful!",28
Toph,"[  Enraged.  ] What? Look here, sugar queen, [  Points finger at Katara.  ] I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending. So don't you talk to me about being selfish!",28
Katara,"[  Furiously.  ]  ""Sugar queen""  ?! [  Toph uses earthbending to close the door of the tent.  ] D-did you just slam the door in my face?! How can you be so infuriating?!",28
Aang,Should we do something?,28
Sokka,"[  Amused.  ] Hey, I'm just enjoying the show.",28
Aang,"[  Approaching Katara.  ] Okay, okay, you both need to calm down.",28
Katara,"""Both""?! [  Rapidly turns to face Aang, her expression crazed and her eyes bloodshot.  ]  I'm completely calm!!",28
Aang,[  Awkwardly.  ] I ... can see that. [  Backs off.  ],28
Katara,"[  Mockingly.  ] The stars sure are beautiful tonight. Too bad you can't see them, Toph!",28
Sokka,"[  Annoyed; pushes Katara off to the side.  ] Hey, how's a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling [  To Toph.  ] and earthquaking?",28
Toph,[  Reopens her tent.  ] That thing is back!,28
Sokka,"Well, how far away is it? [  Lies down and pulls covers of his sleeping bag over his head; says in a muffled voice.  ] Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes.",28
Aang,"[  Notices the smoke.  ] I don't think so, Sokka.",28
Katara,"Seriously, what is that thing?",28
Toph,And how does it keep finding us?,28
Aang,"[  Resting against the saddle; Sokka is seen lying on his back, sleeping.  ] I don't know. But this time, I'm going to make sure we lose it.",28
Sokka,"[  Lands onto the ground.  ] Okay, forget about setting up camp. [  Crawls along the ground in sleeping bag.  ] I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.",28
Katara,[  Angrily; pulling her sleeping bag under her head as a pillow.  ] That's good because Toph wasn't going to help anyway!,28
Toph,"[  Irritated; lying on bag.  ] Oh, I didn't realize the baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed.",28
Aang,"Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what [  Pulls top part of his shirt over his head; says in a muffled voice.  ] or who it is.",28
Katara,It could be Zuko. [  Rolls over on her side.  ] We haven't seem him since the North Pole.,28
Toph,Who's Zuko?,28
Sokka,"[  Puts his head down.  ] Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.",28
Katara,"[  Mockingly.  ] What's wrong with ponytails, Ponytail?",28
Sokka,[  Points to his top-knot.  ] This is a warrior's wolf tail.,28
Katara,"[  Jokingly.  ] Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky.",28
Sokka,"[  Raises head, unamused.  ] Anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh?",28
Sokka,"[  Hold up finger to silence the lemur.  ] No Momo, shhh. [  Relaxes.  ] Sleepy time.",28
Sokka,"[  Buries face in hands.  ] Oh, don't tell me ...",28
Aang,That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us.,28
Toph,I can feel it with my own two feet!,28
Katara,[  Nervously.  ] Let's get out of here.,28
Aang,"[  Calmly.  ] Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly.",28
Sokka,[  Hopelessly.  ] Always the optimist ...,28
Katara,[  Alarmed.  ] It's those three girls from Omashu!,28
Toph,[  Determined.  ] We can take them. Three on three.,28
Sokka,"Actually Toph, there's four of us.",28
Toph,"[  Sheepishly.  ] Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all.",28
Sokka,"[  Turning to her, his face distorted with rage.  ] I can still fight!",28
Toph,"[  Smugly.  ] Okay, three on three plus Sokka.",28
Sokka,[  Face turns red.  ] Errrgh!,28
Sokka,"Well, we wanted to find out who they were and we found out. [  Puts boomerang away; Aang and Katara are seen fleeing.  ] Now let's get out of here.",28
Aang,"Appa, yip yip!",28
Katara,[  Shocked.  ] I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu.,28
Toph,[  Grumpily.  ] I still think we could have taken them.,28
Katara,"Are you kidding me? [  Points fingers upward repeatedly in gesture.  ] The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them, one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary.",28
Sokka,"[  Complaining.  ] Oh no, the sun is rising. We've been up all night with no sleep!",28
Aang,"[  Calmly.  ] Sokka, we'll be okay.",28
Sokka,[  Nervously.  ] Are you sure? I've never not slept before! [  Holds hands up to his head.  ] What if I fall asleep now and something happens? [  Freaks out; eyes bulge out.  ] And something always happens!,28
Katara,"Every time we land, those girls are there. So we'll just have to keep flying.",28
Aang,We can't keep flying forever.,28
Aang,[  Yawns.  ] So what's our plan?,28
Toph,"[  Slumped against the saddle, exhausted.  ] Don't know ... too tired to think.",28
Katara,I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap. [  Smiles.  ],28
Sokka,[  Relieved.  ] Yes ... sleep.,28
Toph,[  Frantically.  ] What's going on?,28
Aang,Appa fell asleep!,28
Aang,"[  Urgently.  ] Wake up, buddy!",28
Aang,Appa's exhausted.,28
Sokka,"[  Trudging across the ground, carrying his sleeping bag.  ] Okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them. The plan right now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep.",28
Katara,"[  Irritated.  ] Of course, we could've gotten some sleep earlier, [  Depicts shot of Toph lying on the ground sleepily.  ] if Toph didn't have such issues.",28
Toph,[  Wakes up and slams the ground; screams furiously.  ] What!?,28
Aang,"[  Trying to calm the tension.  ] All right, all right, everyone's exhausted! Let's just get some rest.",28
Toph,"[  Rises and faces Katara.  ] No, I want to hear what Katara has to say. You think I have issues?",28
Katara,"[  Irritated.  ] I'm just saying. Maybe if you helped out earlier, we could have set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep [  Shouting.  ] and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!",28
Toph,You're blaming me for this?,28
Aang,"[  Desperately.  ] No! No, she's not blaming you.",28
Katara,"[  Angrily.  ] No, I'm blaming her!",28
Toph,"Hey, [  Shoves Aang out of the way.  ] I never asked you for diddly-doo-dah. [  Points her thumb at herself.  ] I carry my own weight. Besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's Sheddy over here!",28
Aang,[  Sitting on Appa's tail.  ] What? You're blaming Appa?,28
Toph,"Yeah, you want to know how they keep finding us? [  Grabs a handful of Appa's fur and lets the sheddings blow away in the wind.  ] He's leaving a trail everywhere we go!",28
Aang,"[  Jumps down to face her.  ] How dare you blame Appa! He saved your life three times today! If there's anyone to blame it's you! You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not. He is! Appa's carrying your weight. He never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us!",28
Toph,"[  Stomps the ground, launching her pack into the air which she catches.  ] I'm out of here.",28
Sokka,"[  Moves in front of Toph, his arms outstretched to halt her.  ] Wait!",28
Aang,What did I just do? [  Slumps.  ] I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone.,28
Katara,[  Regretfully.  ] I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other. And I was so mean to her.,28
Sokka,"[  From afar, drinking from a cup.  ] Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.",28
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Thanks, Sokka.",28
Sokka,No problem.,28
Katara,We need to find Toph and apologize.,28
Sokka,"Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?",28
Aang,[  Grabs a handful of fur and watches as it blows away in the wind.  ] I have a plan.,28
Aang,"Toph was right. The fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail.",28
Katara,Are you sure he's okay to fly?,28
Aang,He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here. [  Kneels down and places pieces of Appa's fur into his satchel.  ] I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off-course.,28
Iroh,Ow ... That really hurt my tailbone.,28
Mai,[  Off camera; dryly.  ] Wads of wet fur. How delightful.,28
Ty Lee,"[  Thoughtfully.  ] Hmmm ... they're not wads, they're more like bundles, or bunches? [  Scratching her head.  ] It's got an ""uh"" sound.",28
Mai,[  Unamused.  ] Clumps?,28
Ty Lee,[  Clasps her hands together and says brightly.  ] Clumps! They're clumps! [  Hugs Mai.  ],28
Mai,"[  To Azula, pointing in direction of the trail.  ] The trail goes this way.",28
Azula,The Avatar's trying to give us the slip. [  Pointing to the broken treetops.  ] You two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison. [  Looking down at fur trail.  ] I'll follow this trail.,28
Sokka,"[  Surveying the woods.  ] Toph couldn't have made it too far. [  Momo begins to chitter and rears up defensively.  ] What is it, Momo? Ooooh, no! Katara!",28
Katara,[  Shocked; urges Appa forward.  ] How did they find us?,28
Sokka,"[  Urgently.  ] Appa, come on, we need to go faster!",28
Katara,He's too tired!,28
Sokka,"[  Frantically.  ] Not good, not good! [  Appa grunts. Cuts to ground level view of Mai and Ty Lee chasing after them. Cuts to shot of Appa heading toward the river.  ] We just need to make it across that river!",28
Katara,"[  Pleading.  ] Come on Appa, just a little further ...",28
Sokka,[  Voice-over.  ] We made it! We're safe.,28
Katara,[  Voice-over.  ] You did it Appa!,28
Sokka,"[  Well off-balance.  ] Good try, but no.",28
Sokka,How are you doing?,28
Katara,"[  Frantically.  ] Well, you know ...",28
Mai,"[  Dryly.  ] I thought when Ty Lee and I finally caught you guys, it would be more exciting. Oh well, victory is boring.",28
Sokka,"[  Still lying on the ground.  ] Thanks Appa, I don't know what we'd do without you.",28
Ty Lee,"[  Wringing out her braid.  ] Was it just me, or was that guy kind of cute?",28
Aang,"All right, you've caught up with me. Now, who are you and what do you want?",28
Azula,"[  Coolly.  ] You mean you haven't guessed? You don't see the family resemblance? Here's a hint. [  Covers her eye and deepens her voice, imitating Zuko.  ] I must find the Avatar to restore my honor! [  Aang remains silent; back in her normal voice.  ] It's okay, you can laugh. It's funny.",28
Aang,So what now?,28
Azula,"[  Cuts to view of her left side.  ] Now? Now, it's over. You're tired and you have no place to go. [  Cuts to view of her face.  ] You can run, but I'll catch you.",28
Aang,[  Rises to face her.  ] I'm not running.,28
Iroh,[  Handing her a cup of tea.  ] Here is your tea. [  Cuts to shot of Toph staring blankly at the ground and back to Iroh.  ] You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.,28
Toph,[  Taking the tea from his hand.  ] You seem a little too old.,28
Iroh,[  Laughs.  ] Perhaps I am.,28
Toph,[  Casually.  ] I know what you're thinking ... I look like I can't handle being by myself.,28
Iroh,I wasn't thinking that.,28
Toph,You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea!,28
Iroh,I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.,28
Toph,"People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me, but I can take care of myself, by myself.",28
Iroh,"You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you. Not that I love you, I just met you.",28
Toph,[  Laughs.  ] So where is your nephew?,28
Iroh,I've been tracking him actually.,28
Toph,Is he lost?,28
Iroh,"[  Looks away; slightly sad.  ] Yes, a little bit. [  Cuts to shot of the rocky ledge where the two sit, the mountain region in the background; voice-over.  ] His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He's trying to figure out who he is and he went away.",28
Toph,So now you're following him.,28
Iroh,"I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there.",28
Toph,"Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it. [  Gets up to leave.  ] Thank you.",28
Iroh,My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.,28
Toph,"[  Happily.  ] No, thank you for what you said. It helped me.",28
Iroh,I'm glad.,28
Toph,"[  Rises to leave, but turns around briefly.  ] Oh, and about your nephew, maybe you should tell him that you need him, too.",28
Azula,Do you really want to fight me?,28
Zuko,"Yes, I really do.",28
Aang,[  Alarmed.  ] Zuko!,28
Azula,"[  Calmly.  ] I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu.",28
Aang,"[  Covers mouth to suppress laughter.  ] ""Zuzu""?",28
Zuko,"[  Determined.  ] Back off, Azula! He's mine!",28
Azula,[  Assumes a fighting stance.  ] I'm not going anywhere.,28
Aang,[  Thrilled.  ] Katara!,28
Zuko,[  Slightly dazed.  ] Uncle ...,28
Iroh,Get up!,28
Toph,I thought you guys could use a little help.,28
Katara,[  Happily.  ] Thanks.,28
Azula,"[  Coolly, backing up as her enemies surround her.  ] Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors, all working together. I'm done. [  Raises her hands in surrender.  ] I know when I'm beaten. You got me. A princess surrenders with honor.",28
Zuko,[  Horrified.  ] Aaaah!,28
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] Ugggh! [  Looks at Team Avatar.  ] Get away from us!,28
Katara,"Zuko, I can help.",28
Zuko,[  Blasts an arc of fire.  ] Leave!,28
Aang,"Today's the day! [  Lands near a sleeping Sokka.  ] Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! [  Momo chitters and lands on Sokka.  ] And this place, [  Momo moves on to Appa's head.  ] it's perfect, don't you think? Sokka? [  Sokka grumbles and glares at Aang with tired eyes.  ] Oh, you're still sleeping, huh? [  Sokka again grumbles and puts his head back down. Aang whispers.  ] Sorry.",29
Toph,"Goooood morning, [  She puts both her hands on her hips.  ] earthbending student!",29
Aang,"Good morning, Sifu Toph.",29
Katara,"[  Aang bows slightly to Toph; disappointed and tiredly.  ] Hey, you never called me Sifu Katara.",29
Aang,"[  Scratches the back of his head.  ] Well, if you think I should ...",29
Toph,"Sorry, Snoozles, we'll do our earthbending as [  Whispers slightly, though with amusement in her voice.  ] quietly as we can.",29
Aang,"[  Excitedly.  ] So what move are you going to teach me first? [  Stretches out his right arm, his fist clenched, and brings it down like a hammer.  ] Rock-a-lanche? [  He brings his left clenched fist to his right elbow, while his right arm is bent upward, the fist also clenched. He trembles with the motion.  ] The Trembler? Oh, maybe I could learn to make a [  Stretches both arms over his head and starts to spin around.  ] whirlpool out of land!",29
Toph,[  Puts a hand on Aang's chest.  ] Let's start with ... [  Makes the gesture.  ] move a rock.,29
Aang,"[  Claps excitedly.  ] Sounds good, sounds good!",29
Toph,"The key to earthbending is your stance. You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element. If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself.",29
Aang,Like a rock. Got it.,29
Toph,"Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple. [  Slams the rock against the canyon wall.  ] Okay, you ready to give it a try?",29
Aang,"I'm ready. [  Tries to move it, but instead he is forced backward into Appa.  ]",29
Sokka,[  Amused.  ] Rock beats airbender!,29
Lu Ten,"I got you, Dad! [  Playfully jumps on top of Iroh.  ]",29
Iroh,"My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.",29
Zuko,Uncle ... you were unconscious. Azula did this to you. It was a surprise attack.,29
Iroh,"Somehow, that's not so surprising. [  Groans.  ]",29
Zuko,"[  Hands Iroh some tea.  ] I hope I made it the way you like it. [  Iroh takes a sip from the cup and his eyes widen. He lets out a cry of disgust, but manages to mask it.  ]",29
Iroh,"[  Grimaces.  ] Good. That was very ... uhhh ... bracing. [  He is handed another cup, which he throws out secretly behind his shoulder.  ]",29
Zuko,"So Uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her.",29
Iroh,"[  With the exact opposite of Zuko's thoughts.  ] No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down. [  Zuko nods. Iroh grunts as he stands up.  ] It's time to resume your training.",29
Katara,I don't understand what went wrong. He did it exactly the way you did.,29
Aang,Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle?,29
Toph,"No. That's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickety-trick that's going to move that rock. You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this ... [  Jumps up and destroys the rock with her head.  ]",29
Aang,Whoa!,29
Katara,"[  Trying to help Toph teach.  ] I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction.",29
Toph,"Thanks, Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that. [  Moments later; yelling at the top of her lungs.  ] Keep your knees high, Twinkle Toes!",29
Toph,Rock-like!,29
Toph,Rock-like!,29
Sokka,"You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat. Just a bit closer ... [  Jumps but falls into a crack that is in the ground. He looks at the cub.  ] Gotcha! [  Sinks further in.  ] You are one lucky little meat creature.",29
Iroh,"Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.",29
Zuko,"I see. That's why we're drinking tea, to calm the mind.",29
Iroh,"Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes. [  Outside.  ] There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning. [  Steps up, and generates lightning, and shoots it away from the two.  ]",29
Zuko,I'm ready to try it!,29
Iroh,"Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.",29
Toph,"This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. Get in your horse stance! I'm going to roll that boulder down at you. If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock. Like this! [  Stretches out, still in stance.  ]",29
Katara,"Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?",29
Toph,"I'm glad you said something. Actually there is a better way. [  Blindfolds Aang.  ] This way, you'll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara.",29
Aang,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, thanks, Katara!",29
Katara,[  Nervously.  ] Heh.,29
Aang,I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.,29
Toph,"There's nothing to say, you blew it! You had a perfect stance, and a perfect form. But when it came right down to it, you didn't have the guts!",29
Aang,[  Disappointed.  ] I know. I'm sorry.,29
Toph,"Yeah, you  are  sorry! If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender?",29
Aang,"No, I don't think I do.",29
Katara,"Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on. Okay?",29
Aang,"Yeah, that sounds good.",29
Toph,"Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better.",29
Zuko,Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face ... like everything always does.,29
Iroh,I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.,29
Zuko,What turmoil?,29
Iroh,"Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.",29
Zuko,But I don't feel any shame at all. I'm as proud as ever.,29
Iroh,"Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.",29
Zuko,"Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately.",29
Iroh,"I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself. [  Zuko smiles.  ]",29
Sokka,"You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute. Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty. [  The cub brings an apple.  ] Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off! That's okay, I got it. [  Tosses his boomerang at it in a desperate attempt.  ] Now, come back boomerang.",29
Katara,"You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?",29
Aang,I don't want to talk about it.,29
Katara,"You do realize that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it–",29
Aang,"[  Frustrated at himself.  ] I know, I know, I know, I know! I get it, all right? I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't, but I can't.",29
Katara,"Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?",29
Aang,I guess it's earth.,29
Katara,"That's why it's so difficult for you to get this. You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will. Think fast! [  Throws a piece of reed at him, but Aang slices it in half with waterbending.  ] Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.",29
Aang,"Thanks, Katara.  Sifu  Katara. [  Bows.  ]",29
Iroh,"Fire is the element of power. [  Draws the firebending insignia in the dirt.  ] The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. [  Draws the earthbending insignia.  ] The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. [  Draws the airbending insignia.  ] The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor! [  Smiles broadly but returns to a more serious demeanor when Zuko doesn't react at all.  ] Water is the element of change. [  Draws the waterbending insignia.  ] The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.",29
Zuko,Why are you telling me these things?,29
Iroh,"It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. [  Divides the four insignias into separate sections.  ] Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole. [  Draws a circle around the insignias.  ]",29
Zuko,All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.,29
Iroh,"It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But it can make you more powerful, too. You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.",29
Toph,"Aang, I found these nuts in your bag. I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it.",29
Aang,"As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have.",29
Toph,"You know, I'm really glad you feel that way. Because I also have this great new nutcracker.",29
Aang,"Actually, I prefer if you didn't ... [  Crack.  ] That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ... [  Crack.  ] It's a delicate instrument!",29
Toph,"It's not the only delicate instrument around here. [  Walks away, hitting the staff off rocks.  ]",29
Aang,[  Resumes meditating.  ] Ohm.,29
Katara,"Hey Aang, have you seen–",29
Aang,[  Frustrated.  ] Meditating here!,29
Katara,It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.,29
Aang,We'll find him faster if we split up. [  The two begin to search.  ],29
Sokka,"Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? [  Sokka's warrior's wolf tail gets yanked out of his hair by the cub.  ] Ow! That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal? [  Aang shows up.  ] Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat?",29
Aang,Sokka! Are you okay? [  Tries to pull him out.  ],29
Sokka,"Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!",29
Aang,Hmmm ... I bet I can airbend you out of here. [  Blows up a gust of wind but Sokka remains trapped.  ],29
Sokka,"Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?",29
Aang,I can't ... I can't do it.,29
Sokka,"Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph.",29
Aang,I can't do that either.,29
Sokka,You can't? Why not?,29
Aang,It would just be really ... uncomfortable.,29
Sokka,"Uncomfortable? [  Sarcastically.  ] Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ...",29
Aang,"Thanks, Sokka. This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position.",29
Sokka,"Awkward position, I think I know the feeling.",29
Aang,"If I try, I fail. If I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.",29
Sokka,"Hmmm ... how about that. Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.",29
Aang,"Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub.",29
Sokka,Really? He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion.,29
Aang,It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. What are you doing out here little guy? Did you lose your mama?,29
Iroh,"Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning.",29
Zuko,You can teach me to redirect lightning?,29
Iroh,"If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean. [  Laughs.  ] From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this. [  The two begin to practice the redirection motion.  ] Now, are you focusing your energy? Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?",29
Zuko,I think so.,29
Iroh,"Come on, you've got to feel the flow. [  They practice the motion for a few minutes.  ] Excellent! You've got it!",29
Zuko,"Great, I'm ready to try it with real lightning!",29
Iroh,"What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous!",29
Zuko,I thought that was the point! You teaching me to protect myself from it!,29
Iroh,"Yeah! But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!",29
Zuko,"Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning. [  Rides away.  ]",29
Aang,"Hey there, we found your cub! See, we have no problem with you! We're friendly!",29
Sokka,"Aang, this is bad, you've got to get me out of here!",29
Sokka,"This is really bad! Please Aang, you have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!",29
Aang,"Oh no! [  Gets on top of a rock to try and distract the saber-tooth moose-lion.  ] Woo-hoo, look at me!",29
Sokka,"Please, don't leave me again.",29
Aang,I won't.,29
Sokka,What are you doing here?,29
Toph,Just enjoying the show.,29
Aang,What? You were there the whole time?,29
Toph,Pretty much.,29
Aang,Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could have gotten him out and helped us get away!,29
Toph,Guess it just didn't occur to me. [  Throws a nut down and attempts to crack it with the staff.  ],29
Aang,[  Grabs hold of it.  ] Enough! I want my staff back! [  Takes it away.  ],29
Toph,Do it now!,29
Aang,What?,29
Toph,"Earthbend, Twinkle Toes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast. And even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got stuff.",29
Aang,But–,29
Toph,Do it!,29
Toph,You did it! You're an earthbender.,29
Aang,I can't believe it!,29
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment. So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?",29
Aang,"No problem, Sokka!",29
Toph,"Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. You might accidentally crush him.",29
Sokka,"Yeah, no crushing, please.",29
Katara,You found him! [  Embraces Sokka.  ],29
Sokka,"The whole time, I was in that hole, not knowing if I was going to live or die. It makes a man to think about what's really important. I realized–",29
Aang,"[  Interrupting Sokka.  ] Hey Katara, look what I can do! [  Bends a rock and slams it on the ground.  ]",29
Katara,"You did it! I knew you would! [  Whispering to Toph.  ] You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?",29
Toph,"[  Happily.  ] Yep, it worked wonders.",29
Aang,"Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted. Physically and mentally unmovable!",29
Zuko,"You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it, and now I can give it back! [  Yelling as loud as he can at the storm.  ] Come on, strike me! You've never held back before!",29
Sokka,What's out here?,30
Toph,"[  Puts her hand on the ground.  ] A lot, actually. There's hundreds of little ...",30
Aang,"[  Turns around and silences Toph.  ] Shh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch. [  Blows a note on the flute. A groundhog-type creature pops out of a hole in the ground and mimics the note.  ] Yeah! [  Plays another note and another groundhog mimics it.  ] I'm putting an orchestra together.",30
Sokka,"[  Makes hand motions while looking on with annoyance.  ] Orchestra, huh? Well, la-di-da.",30
Sokka,"[  Annoyed.  ] This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans.",30
Toph,We  did  make plans. We're all picking mini-vacations.,30
Sokka,There's no time for vacations.,30
Aang,I'm learning the elements as fast as I can. I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrow off!,30
Katara,"[  Walks next to Aang.  ] Yeah, what's wrong with having a little fun in our down time?",30
Sokka,"Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the Fire Nation. [  Gestures to the side, sarcastically.  ] Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? [  Knocking on an imaginary door.  ] Knock, knock. Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war.",30
Katara,"[  Giggles.  ] All right, we'll finish our vacations and [  Mockingly.  ] then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence. [  Aang laughs.  ]",30
Aang,"[  Opening a map and shows it to Katara.  ] Your turn, Katara. Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?",30
Katara,[  Pointing at the map.  ] How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.,30
Aang,"Oh, yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring. And I usually don't use the word ""pristine"". [  Cut to the symbol on the map.  ] It's one of nature's wonders.",30
Aang,Must've changed ownership since I was here. [  Laughs sheepishly.  ],30
Zei,"[  To the bartender.  ] One mango, please.",30
Sokka,I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy. [  Runs up to the bartender.  ] Excuse me.,30
Aang,"No worries, I clean up easy. [  Airbends the drink off of his clothes.  ]",30
Zei,[  Gasps.  ] You're a living relic.,30
Aang,"[  Shrugs.  ] Thanks, I try.",30
Zei,"An Air Nomad, right in front of me. [  Shot changes to show Katara holding an icy bowl.  ] Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University. [  Grabs Aang's arm and points at his arrow tattoo. Camera pans to Aang's face.  ] Tell me, which of the air temples do you hail from?",30
Aang,The Southern Temple.,30
Zei,"[  Measures Aang's head with a pair of calipers and speaking excitedly.  ] Oh, splendid! Now tell me- what was the primary agricultural product of your people?",30
Aang,"[  Nervously.  ] Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?",30
Zei,"Oh, truly fascinating. That is one for the journal. [  While Sokka speaks, Zei writes in his journal.  ]",30
Sokka,"So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated.",30
Zei,Certainly.,30
Sokka,"What, no Fire Nation? [  Straightening his back.  ] Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?",30
Katara,[  Examines the map while the camera pans across it.  ] You've made a lot of trips into the desert.,30
Zei,"All in vain, I'm afraid. I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom, [  Raises his fist slightly.  ] but I haven't managed to find the crown jewel: Wan Shi Tong's Library. [  Cut to a shot of Toph laying down. Her feet are closest to the camera, showing her dirt-stained soles.  ]",30
Toph,[  In disbelief.  ] You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library?,30
Zei,"This library is more valuable than gold, little lady. It is said to contain a vast collection of knowledge, and knowledge is priceless.",30
Toph,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Hmm, sounds like good times.",30
Zei,"Oh, it is. According to legend, it was built by the great Knowledge Spirit, Wan Shi Tong, with the help of his ""foxy"" knowledge seekers.",30
Sokka,"[  Intrigued.  ] Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?",30
Katara,"[  Puts her hand on the side of Sokka's face to stop him from talking.  ] I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.",30
Zei,"You're both right. [  Katara and Sokka turn to him in surprise. Cut to Zei.  ] Handsome little creatures. [  Takes out a drawing of the library and places it on the table.  ] Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge seekers collected books from all over the world, and put them on display for mankind to read, so that we might better ourselves.",30
Sokka,"If this place has books from all over the world, [  Aang walks over to look at the maps while he sips his drink.  ] do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map, maybe?",30
Zei,"I wouldn't know. But if such a thing exists, it's in Wan Shi Tong's Library.",30
Sokka,"Then it's settled. Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation [  Cut to a shot of Sokka as he points his finger into the air dramatically. The background changes to a rushing one.  ] at the library! [  Sokka's voice echoes. Zoom back to a group shot, with Sokka still having his finger raised in the air.  ]",30
Toph,"[  Waving her hand to gain the others attention.  ] Uh, hey, what about me? When do I get to pick?",30
Sokka,You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.,30
Toph,Hmph! [  Slams her drink on the table and folds her arms. Cut to a shot of Zei.  ],30
Zei,"Of course, there's the matter of finding it. I've made several trips into the Si Wong Desert and almost died each time. [  In a depressed voice.  ] I'm afraid that desert's impossible to cross.",30
Sokka,"Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?",30
Zei,A sky bison?! You actually have one?,30
Zei,"[  Runs toward the sandbenders.  ] Sandbenders, shoo, away from the bison!",30
Zei,"Tell me, sky bison, are you the last of your breed? [  Appa growls and Zei responds enthusiastically.  ] Delightful! I only wish I spoke his tongue. [  Scratches Appa's head.  ] Oh, the stories this beast could tell. [  Momo crawls up to Zei's side and starts chittering.  ] Shush, chatty monkey.",30
Aang,"[  Examines the picture of the library.  ] Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.",30
Toph,[  Groans in frustration.  ] Does this place even exist?,30
Zei,Some say it doesn't.,30
Toph,"[  Eyes widen in surprise before narrowing.  ] Shouldn't you have mentioned that before? [  Collapses on the saddle, putting her feet over the side.  ]",30
Toph,"[  Pointing over the side of the saddle with excitement.  ] There it is! [  Everybody on Appa looks to where Toph is pointing, but they can only see sand dunes. Aang, Katara, and Sokka glare at Toph in annoyance for tricking them. Cut back to the shot of Toph.  ] That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it. [  Waves her hand in front of her face with a blank grin to remind them of the fact that she is blind. She quickly goes back to clutching the saddle.  ]",30
Katara,"It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant, ornate building from the air.",30
Sokka,"[  Looks through his telescope and spots a tower. Pointing.  ] Down there, what's that?",30
Katara,[  Holding the illustrations.  ] Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. [  Side shot.  ] The building in this drawing is enormous.,30
Sokka,[  To Zei.  ] What kind of animal is that?,30
Zei,"I think that was one of the Knowledge Seekers. [  Frontal shot.  ] Oh, we must be close to the library!",30
Sokka,"[  Looking at the illustration Katara is holding.  ] No, this is the library- look! [  Camera pans down from the tower to the illustration.  ] It's completely buried.",30
Zei,"[  Shouting dramatically.  ] The library is buried?! [  Cut to a shot of the group standing in front of the spire. Zei runs forward. Depressed.  ] My life's ambition is now full of sand. [  Collapses. Smiling, he lifts his head and reveals a small shovel in hand. Excitedly.  ] Well, time to start excavating. [  He attempts to unearth the library using the tiny shovel. Cut to a close-up of the spire's surface as Toph places her palm against it.  ]",30
Toph,"[  Cut a small part of the library which Toph puts her hand on.  ] Actually, that won't be necessary. The inside seems to be completely intact. [  Aerial shot.  ] And it's huge.",30
Sokka,That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look.,30
Toph,I say you guys go ahead without me.,30
Katara,You got something against libraries?,30
Toph,"I've held books before. And I gotta tell you, they don't exactly do it for me.",30
Katara,"[  Sheepishly.  ] Oh, right. Sorry.",30
Toph,Let me know if they have something you can listen to.,30
Aang,"[  To Appa.  ] Don't worry, buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph. [  Walks off camera.  ]",30
Toph,[  Awkwardly.  ] What's up?,30
Zei,"Oh, it's breathtaking! [  Shot changes to show Zei, Aang, and Sokka climb down the rope with owl arches in the background.  ] The spirit spared no expense in designing this place. [  Pointing.  ] Look at those beautiful buttresses! [  Cut to an above shot of Sokka, Aang, and Zei, who are hanging from the rope. Sokka and Aang giggle at the word.  ] What's funny?",30
Aang,Nothing. We just like architecture.,30
Zei,[  Cut back to a smiling Zei.  ] As do I.,30
Zei,"My word! [  Examines an owl mosaic above two pillars.  ] The exquisite mosaic handiwork of this tile-rendered avian symbol ... [  Sokka, Katara, and Aang look at Zei quizzically.  ] Eh, nice owl.",30
Wan Shi Tong,[  Turns his head around.  ] I know you're back there.,30
Zei,"[  Smiles and walks from behind the pillar and up to Wan Shi Tong.  ] Hello, I'm Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University.",30
Wan Shi Tong,You should leave the way you came. [  Looks to the side.  ] Unless you want to become a  stuffed  head of anthropology.,30
Sokka,Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?,30
Wan Shi Tong,"Indeed, I am Wan Shi Tong, ""He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things."" And you are obviously humans, which, by the way, are no longer permitted in my study.",30
Aang,What do you have against humans?,30
Wan Shi Tong,"Hm! Humans only bother learning things to get the edge on other humans. [  Cut to Zhao, studying scrolls in the library. Voice-over.  ] Like that firebender who came to this place a few years ago, looking to destroy his enemy. [  Scene changes to the present.  ] So ... [  Leans toward a sweating Sokka.  ] who are you trying to destroy?",30
Sokka,[  Cut to his reflection in Wan Shi Tong's eye.  ] What? No-no-no-no destroying. We're not into that.,30
Wan Shi Tong,[  Blinks.  ] Then why have you come here?,30
Sokka,Um ... knowledge for knowledge's sake?,30
Wan Shi Tong,"[  Shot changes to him leaning toward Sokka.  ] If you're going to lie to an all-knowing spirit being, you should at least put some effort into it.",30
Sokka,"I'm not lying, I'm here with the Avatar, [  Grabs Aang and puts him into the shot.  ] and he's the bridge between our worlds. He'll vouch for me. [  Nudges Aang.  ]",30
Aang,"Ow. [  Frontal shot.  ] Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit. [  Side shot.  ] You have my word. [  They bow to Wan Shi Tong.  ]",30
Wan Shi Tong,"Hmm, very well. I'll let you peruse my vast collection [  Shot changes to Zei, Aang, Katara, and Sokka looking hopefully.  ] on one condition. [  They look at the spirit a little worriedly. Further overhead shot.  ] To prove your worth as scholars, you have to contribute some worthwhile knowledge.",30
Zei,[  Walks up to Wan Shi Tong holding a book and kneels down.  ] Please accept this tome as a donation to your library.,30
Wan Shi Tong,"[  Frontal shot.  ] First edition, very nice. [  Grabs the book with his wing.  ]",30
Katara,[  Camera pans up to show her holding the waterbending scroll.  ] I have an authentic waterbending scroll.,30
Wan Shi Tong,"[  Frontal shot.  ] Ooh, these illustrations are quite stylish. [  Grabs the scroll.  ]",30
Aang,"[  Cut to him.  ] Uh ... oh, I know! [  Grabs his wanted poster out of his shirt and shows it to Wan Shi Tong.  ] Hah!",30
Wan Shi Tong,I suppose that counts. [  Takes the poster.  ],30
Sokka,"[  Side shot of him walking forward.  ] Oh, great spirit, [  Frontal shot of him holding a piece of string.  ] check this out. [  Ties the string into a butterfly knot and shows it to Wan Shi Tong.  ] Ta-da! [  Aang, Katara, and Zei look at Sokka with uncertainty. Shot of Wan Shi Tong just looking at him in silence.  ] It's a special knot. That counts as knowledge!",30
Wan Shi Tong,"[  Frontal shot.  ] You're not very bright, are you? [  Sokka grunts as Wan Shi Tong takes the knot.  ] Enjoy the library. [  Jumps off the bridge and flies down to lower levels of the library.  ]",30
Sokka,[  Narrows his eyes.  ] Bright enough to fool you.,30
Toph,"[  To Appa.  ] So ... you like ... flying? [  Appa purrs deeply and scratches his ear.  ] Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground where I can see. Well, I don't  see  the way you do. I feel the vibrations in the ground with my feet. [  Closer shot of the two. Toph picks up a handful of sand and lets it fall.  ] But this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy. [  Appa makes a rumbling groan with a further shot.  ] Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy. [  Appa grunts.  ]",30
Aang,"[  Holds the illustration up to show Sokka and Katara.  ] Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things.",30
Sokka,"[  Pulls a book off the bookshelf with the symbols 子白 on the cover.  ] Eh, I've seen weirder.",30
Katara,"[  Walks up to Aang, carrying a book.  ] Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left-handed?",30
Aang,I always knew I was special.,30
Sokka,"[  Reading from the parchment.  ] ""The darkest day in Fire Nation history."" It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else. [  He looks around, making sure no one is watching, before prying open the frame with his sword and taking the parchment.  ]",30
Aang,"[  Walks in with Katara and Zei.  ] Sokka, where are you going?",30
Sokka,"[  Running down a section of a library.  ] I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day. This could be promising. [  Aang, Katara, and Zei follow him.  ] The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here.",30
Aang,[  Looking at a room full of ashes.  ] Firebenders.,30
Katara,They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation.,30
Sokka,"That's so unfair! Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago. [  Collapses on his knees.  ] I need to know what happened on the darkest day. [  Hears whimpering and looks at the entrance to see the Knowledge Seeker standing on its hind legs.  ] Hello, little weird fox guy.",30
Zei,Seems it's trying to assist you.,30
Sokka,"Um, sure, I guess I'll follow you.",30
Zei,"This room is a true marvel, a mechanical wonder. It's a planetarium that shows the heavens moving.",30
Sokka,"Uh, this is beautiful, but how is it helpful?",30
Katara,"Maybe these dials represent dates and times. Sokka, try entering that date from that parchment you took.",30
Sokka,"[  Mock whispering.  ] Shh, Katara, not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.",30
Aang,"Wow, I got to hand it to you, Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation for sure.",30
Katara,"Hey, wait. What happened to the sun?",30
Aang,"[  Narrows his eyes.  ] Great, you must have broken it.",30
Sokka,"[  Walks next to Aang.  ] It's not broken. [  Shot changes to show the sun piece of the planetarium covered by the moon piece.  ] The sun is behind the moon. It's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it. [  Grabs Aang's shoulders and shakes him.  ] Something awful happened on that day. I don't know what, but I do know why. Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse. [  Pushes Aang back.  ] Sorry.",30
Katara,"That makes sense. I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge.",30
Sokka,"[  To the Knowledge Seeker.  ] Fine, you earned it. [  Tosses the fox a snack from his bag. To Aang and Katara.  ] We've gotta get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is going down!",30
Wan Shi Tong,"[  Enters the shot from behind Sokka.  ] Mortals are so predictable, and such terrible liars. [  Sokka gulps. Shot changes to show Wan Shi Tong talking to them from the entrance.  ] You betrayed my trust. From the beginning, you intended to misuse this knowledge for evil purposes.",30
Sokka,"You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information.",30
Wan Shi Tong,You think you're the first person to believe their war was justified? Countless others before you have come here seeking weapons or weaknesses or battle strategies.,30
Aang,"We had no choice. Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love.",30
Wan Shi Tong,And now I'm going to protect what  I  love. [  Flaps his wings and the library starts shaking.  ],30
Aang,What are you doing?,30
Wan Shi Tong,I'm taking my knowledge back. No one will ever abuse it again.,30
Katara,[  Sand pours from the ceiling.  ] He's sinking the building. We've gotta get out of here.,30
Wan Shi Tong,"I'm afraid I can't allow that. You already know too much. [  Pecks at them, but misses.  ]",30
Toph,"I already  told  you, I don't wanna snuggle. [  Appa stands up and hurries away from the library. Toph looks at the sinking library.  ] Library sinking. [  Running up to the library.  ] Library sinking! [  Punches both fists into the library to stop it from sinking. Her feet slip in the sand, so she pauses to solidify it.  ] Hi-yah! [  Struggles to stop it from sinking again.  ]",30
Zei,"[  Stops running and turns back toward Wan Shi Tong.  ] Great Knowledge Spirit, I beg you, do not destroy your vast collection of priceless tomes.",30
Aang,"[  Runs back to Katara, Zei, and Sokka.  ] We've gotta get back to the surface!",30
Katara,"Sokka, let's go.",30
Sokka,But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna to happen.,30
Katara,Don't be stupid! We'll find out later!,30
Sokka,"No, we won't. If we leave this place, we'll never get the information. Aang, come with me to the planetarium, [  Aang runs up to him.  ] I need cover. Katara, take Momo and get out of here!",30
Katara,But ...!,30
Sokka,Go!,30
Katara,"Hurry, Sokka!",30
Toph,What is it now?,30
Toph,[  Struggling.  ] Who's there?,30
Aang,Why are we doing this?,30
Sokka,"Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be.",30
Aang,You can't possibly check every single date.,30
Sokka,"[  Adjusting the calendar wheel.  ] I don't have to. We just need to check every date before Sozin's Comet arrives. Because after that- well, try not to think about that.",30
Aang,"[  Pushing the lever.  ] Come on, eclipse.",30
Sokka,"That's it! The solar eclipse! It's just a few months away. [  Takes out a piece of paper and writes down the date.  ] Got it. Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.",30
Toph,Don't make me put this down.,30
Toph,"No! Stop sinking! [  Fires three more slices of sand.  ] No! [  Grabs the library.  ] I'm sorry, Appa. [  Closes her eyes as the camera pans to show the sand-sailers dragging Appa away.  ]",30
Wan Shi Tong,At least I'll have one specimen to add to my collection.,30
Wan Shi Tong,"Your waterbending won't do you much good here. [  Raises his head and unfolds his wings to attack.  ] I've studied Northern water style, Southern water style, even Foggy Swamp style.",30
Sokka,That's called Sokka style. [  Swings his fist to the side as he says this.  ] Learn it.,30
Sokka,"Wait! Professor, let's go.",30
Zei,[  Sitting among a pile of books holding a scroll that surrounds him. The sand is building up and beginning to cover some of the stacks. Zei is reading a scroll. The camera slowly zooms in.  ] I'm not leaving. I can't. [  Drops the parchment to his lap and raises his right fist.  ] I've spent too long trying to find this place. [  Places his hand on his chest and looks up.  ] There's not another collection of knowledge like this on earth. [  Cut to a close-up of Zei with his eyes closed. He opens his eyes while smiling and speaks wistfully.  ] I could spend an eternity in here.,30
Katara,[  Cut to a shot of Sokka and Katara looking at the professor. Katara looks up at Sokka.  ] Just go!,30
Sokka,We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming. [  Jumps and hugs his sister.  ] The Fire Nation's in trouble now!,30
Aang,[  Stands up and walks toward Toph.  ] Where's Appa?,30
Aang,[  Enraged.  ] How could you let them take Appa?! ‌ Why didn't you stop them‌?!,31
Toph,[  Defensively.  ] I couldn't! The library was sinking! You guys were still inside and-,31
Aang,[  Still enraged.  ] You could've come to get us. I could've saved him!,31
Toph,[  Turns to face him slightly.  ] I can hardly feel any vibrations out here. The sandbenders snuck up on me and there wasn't time for –,31
Aang,[  Snaps at Toph in a harsh way.  ] You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone!,31
Katara,"Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives.",31
Sokka,Who's going to save our lives now? We'll never make it out of here.,31
Aang,"That's all any of you guys care about, yourselves! You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!",31
Katara,"We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now.",31
Aang,"[  In a cold, hard tone.  ] I'm going after Appa.",31
Katara,"Aang, wait!",31
Katara,We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to Ba Sing Se.,31
Sokka,"You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?",31
Zuko,Maybe we should make camp.,31
Iroh,"No please, don't stop just for me!",31
Iroh,[  Annoyed.  ] What now?,31
Iroh,Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!,31
Mongke,"If you're surprised we're here, then the Dragon of the West has lost a few steps.",31
Zuko,[  Surprised.  ] You know these guys?,31
Iroh,Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos are legendary. Each one is a different kind of weapon specialist. [  The camera cuts to each member of the Rough Rhinos.  ] They are also a very capable singing group.,31
Mongke,We're not here to give a concert. We're here to apprehend fugitives!,31
Iroh,"[  While rubbing his arm.  ] Would you like some tea first? I'd love some. How about you, Kahchi? I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right?",31
Mongke,Enough stalling! Round 'em up!,31
Iroh,It's nice to see old friends.,31
Zuko,Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you.,31
Iroh,[  Grasping his shoulder again as he racks his brain in search of an answer.  ] Hmmm ... Old friends that don't want to attack me ...,31
Sokka,[  Annoyed.  ] Can't you watch where you're ... [  His eyes widen in comprehension as he sees who bumped into him.  ],31
Toph,No.,31
Sokka,Right. Sorry.,31
Katara,"Come on guys, we've got to stick together.",31
Sokka,"If I sweat anymore, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.",31
Toph,"Katara, can I have some more water?",31
Katara,"Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.",31
Sokka,"[  As he points to his mouth.  ] We're drinking your bending water. [  He tries to define the taste of the water, smacking his lips. Disgustedly he exclaims.  ] You used this on the swamp guy! Urch!",31
Toph,It does taste swampy.,31
Katara,"[  Sad tone.  ] I'm sorry, it's all we have.",31
Sokka,Not anymore! Look!,31
Katara,"[  Worried.  ] Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants!",31
Sokka,There's water trapped inside these!,31
Katara,[  Backing away from Sokka and the cactus.  ] I don't know ...,31
Sokka,[  While cactus juice drips off his chin.  ] Suit yourself. It's very thirst quenching though.,31
Sokka,"[  In a strange echoing voice.  ] Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier. [  He crawls over the ground as a caterpillar before jumping back to the front, pushing his face toward the camera with a big smile.  ] It's the quenchiest!",31
Katara,"Okay, I think you've had enough.",31
Sokka,Who lit Toph on fire?,31
Toph,Can I get some of that cactus?,31
Katara,"[  Wrapping her arm around Toph's shoulders.  ] I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang.",31
Sokka,[  In awe.  ] How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?,31
Aang,Appa! [  He glides down and lands on a dune.  ] Appa!,31
Aang,No ... [  Yelling.  ] No!,31
Katara,What is that?,31
Toph,What? What is what?,31
Sokka,It's a giant mushroom! [  Very excited.  ] Maybe it's friendly!,31
Katara,Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay ...,31
Sokka,Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend!,31
Man,"Yeah, a little barefoot blind girl and her friends passed through here a few days ago.",31
Yu,Did they give you any indication where they were headed‌?,31
Man,Maybe you could give me a little incentive‌?,31
Xin Fu,You suggesting I break your fingers‌?,31
Man,They went in the desert! Too bad there's almost no chance they survived.,31
Xin Fu,"That's okay, 'cause she's wanted dead or alive.",31
Yu,No she's not! I'm certain her father wants her alive.,31
Xin Fu,"Hey, look ... Fire Nation wanted posters!",31
Yu,So?,31
Xin Fu,"So, look who's here.",31
Katara,"I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now but ... we need to focus on getting out of here.",31
Aang,[  Hopelessly.  ] What's the difference? We won't survive without Appa. We all know it.,31
Katara,"[  Encouraging.  ] Come on, Aang. We can do this if we work together. Right Toph?",31
Toph,"As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding. I got nothin'.",31
Katara,[  Hopeful.  ] Sokka? Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?,31
Sokka,[  Pointing up at the sky.  ] Why don't we ask the circle birds?,31
Katara,"[  Grabs her head in annoyance.  ] Ugh ... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody, hold hands. We can do this. We have to.",31
Katara,I think we should stop for the night.,31
Toph,Is there any more water?,31
Katara,This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink.,31
Sokka,"[  Theatrically panics, grabbing his head in despair.  ] Momo, no! You've killed us all!",31
Katara,"No, he hasn't.",31
Sokka,"[  Relieved.  ] Oh, right. Bending.",31
Katara,"Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library.",31
Sokka,[  Offended.  ] What?! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that? [  Pointing an accusing finger at Momo.  ] It was you! You ratted me out!,31
Katara,"Sokka, I was there.",31
Aang,[  Sadly.  ] It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is.,31
Katara,"No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is. We can use the stars to guide us. [  She pulls out a map of the stars.  ] That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day.",31
Katara,Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours.,31
Zuko,No one here is going to help us. These people just look like filthy wanderers.,31
Iroh,"So do we. [  Pointing at something behind Zuko.  ] Ah, this is interesting. I think I found our friend.",31
Zuko,You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?,31
Iroh,I don't think this is a gamble.,31
Xin Fu,Let's take them now!,31
Yu,"This place is full of desperate characters. If they find out we're collecting a bounty, we might have to fight them all just to keep our prize. Patience.",31
Iroh,May I have this game?,31
Fung,[  Gesturing Iroh to sit down.  ] The guest has the first move. [  Iroh places the lotus tile in the center of the board.  ] I see you favor the white lotus gambit. Not many still cling to the ancient ways. [  He cups his hands toward Iroh.  ],31
Iroh,Those who do can always find a friend.,31
Fung,Then let us play.,31
Fung,"Welcome, brother. The White Lotus opens wide to those who know her secrets.",31
Zuko,What are you old gasbags talking about?,31
Iroh,I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.,31
Xin Fu,"I'm not waiting all night for these geezers to finish yapping! [  He walks over to the Pai Sho table, followed by Yu.  ] It's over! You two fugitives are coming with me!",31
Fung,"[  Quickly places himself before Iroh and Zuko, preventing Xin Fu and Yu from reaching them.  ] I knew it! You two are wanted criminals with a giant bounty on your heads!",31
Zuko,I thought you said he would help!,31
Iroh,[  Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder to reassure him.  ] He is. Just watch.,31
Fung,[  To Yu and Xin Fu.  ] You think you're going to capture them and collect all that gold?,31
Man in the bar,Gold?,31
Yu,Uh ... Maybe we shouldn't.,31
Katara,"Come on, get up. We need to go.",31
Toph,Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it just tastes like sand. I never thought I'd miss the taste of mud so much.,31
Aang,I'm awake. I couldn't sleep.,31
Katara,"Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit.",31
Aang,[  Joyfully.  ] Appa!,31
Sokka,"Appa‌? But why would Princess Yue need him‌? She's the moon! [  Grabs Momo's tail, using it to rub his cheek.  ] She flies by herself!",31
Katara,"[  Sadly.  ] It's just a cloud. Wait! A cloud! [  Offers her pouch to Aang.  ] Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch.",31
Katara,[  Disappointed.  ] Wow ... there's hardly any in here.,31
Aang,"[  Lashes out.  ] I'm sorry, okay! It's a desert cloud; I did all I could! What's anyone else doing?! [  Pointing his staff at Katara.  ] What are you doing‌?!",31
Katara,Trying to keep everyone together. Let's just get moving. We need to head this direction.,31
Toph,Ow! Crud! I am so sick of not feeling where I'm going! [  Pointing toward the little rocklike shaped object she tripped over.  ] And what idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desert‌?,31
Katara,A boat‌?,31
Toph,"Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations.",31
Katara,"It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use! And look! It's got some kind of compass on it! [  Tapping the compass.  ] I bet it can point us out of here! Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We're going to make it!",31
Fung,"It is an honor to welcome such a high-ranking member of the Order of the White Lotus. Being a Grand Master, you must know so many secrets.",31
Zuko,"[  Annoyed.  ] Now that you played Pai Sho, are you going to do some flower arranging, or is someone in this club going to offer some real help‌?",31
Iroh,You must forgive my nephew. He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts.,31
Florist,Who knocks at the garden gate‌?,31
Iroh,One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries.,31
Iroh,I'm afraid it's members only. Wait out here.,31
Katara,The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts.,31
Sokka,[  Dreamily.  ] Take it easy little lady. I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here.,31
Katara,That's what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock! It must be the magnetic center of the desert.,31
Toph,[  Ecstatic.  ] A rock‌?! Yes! Let's go!,31
Katara,[  Hopeful.  ] Maybe we can find some water there!,31
Aang,[  Darkly.  ] Maybe we can find some sandbenders.,31
Toph,Ahhh ... Finally! Solid ground!,31
Sokka,[  Breathes deeply.  ] I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice. And look!,31
Sokka,"Tastes like rotten penguin meat! Awww, I feel woozy.",31
Katara,[  Irritated.  ] You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave‌?!,31
Sokka,I have a natural curiosity.,31
Toph,I don't think this is a normal cave. This was carved by something.,31
Aang,Yeah ... look at the shape.,31
Toph,[  Close-up of her feet.  ] There's something buzzing in here. [  Camera pans up to her.  ] Something that's coming for us!,31
Sokka,[  Surprised.  ] What are you doing? That rock almost crushed me!,31
Toph,"Sorry, I can't tell where they are in the air!",31
Sokka,I got this one.,31
Katara,"Sokka, there's nothing there!",31
Sokka,I guess my head's not as clear as I thought.,31
Katara,We have to get out of here! I'm completely out of water to bend!,31
Aang,Momo! I'm not losing anyone else out here.,31
Katara,"Come on, we're going down.",31
Katara,"Toph, shoot a rock right there. Fire!",31
Sokka,"Yeah! You got it! She got it, right‌?",31
Katara,Yes. Now let's move.,31
Katara,On your left!,31
Zuko,What's going on? Is the club meeting over‌?,31
Iroh,Everything is taken care of. We're heading to Ba Sing Se.,31
Zuko,Ba Sing Se? ‌Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital‌?,31
Fung,[  Calmly.  ] The city is filled with refugees. No one will notice two more.,31
Iroh,We can hide in plain sight there. And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation. Even I couldn't break through to the city. [  Happily shrugs his shoulders.  ],31
White Lotus member,"I have the passports for our guests, but there are two men out on the street looking for them.",31
Xin Fu,You seen these guys‌?,31
Sha-Mo,"What are you doing in our land with a sandbender sailer? ‌ From the looks of it, you stole it from the Hami tribe.",31
Katara,We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We're traveling with the Avatar. [  She gestures at Aang. The leader's eyes widen a bit at this information.  ] Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba Sing Se.,31
Ghashiun,You dare accuse our people of theft while you ride in on a stolen sand sailer‌?!,31
Sha-Mo,"Quiet, Ghashiun. No one accused our people of anything. If what they say is true, we must give them hospitality.",31
Ghashiun,"Sorry, father.",31
Toph,I recognize the son's voice. He's the one that stole Appa.,31
Katara,Are you sure?‌,31
Toph,I never forget a voice.,31
Aang,[  Furious.  ] You stole Appa! Where is he? ‌What did you do to him?,31
Ghashiun,They're lying! They're the thieves!,31
Aang,[  Enraged.  ] Where is my bison‌?,31
Xin Fu,"Hey you, where are these men‌? I got a tip that they're in your shop.",31
Florist,"[  Calmly.  ] As you can see, no one is here but us.",31
Yu,We know all about your secret back room. [  To Xin Fu.  ] Kick it down.,31
Florist,Hey! That room is for flowers only!,31
Yu,Some unlucky soul has an incomplete Pai Sho set.,31
Xin Fu,Let's go back to finding the girl.,31
Aang,You tell me where he is now!,31
Sha-Mo:,[  To Ghashiun.  ] What did you do‌?,31
Ghashiun,I-It wasn't me!,31
Toph,You said to put a muzzle on him!,31
Aang,[  Enraged.  ] You muzzled Appa‌?,31
Ghashiun,I'm sorry! I didn't know that it belonged to the Avatar!,31
Aang,[  With the voices of all the Avatars.  ] Tell me where Appa is!,31
Ghashiun,"[  Frightened.  ] I traded him! To some merchants! He's probably in Ba Sing Se by now! They were going to sell him there! [  The sandbenders raise their hands as if to ward off the Avatar's bright, angry glare.  ] Please! We'll escort you out of the desert! We'll help however we can!",31
Sokka,Just get out of here! Run!,31
Katara,[  Excitedly.  ] Waterbending bomb! Yeah! [  Jumps into the water.  ],32
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library. Just splash some water on 'em.",32
Katara,Sorry. [  Wrings her hair dry and bends the water off the map.  ],32
Aang,"So, did you figure out what route we're going to take?",32
Sokka,"Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here. And we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here. It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass.",32
Toph,You sure that's the best way to go?,32
Sokka,"It's the only way. I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.",32
Katara,[  Quietly.  ] Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be sensitive?,32
Aang,"Katara, it's okay. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse.",32
Katara,"[  Surprised.  ] Oh ... well, okay. I'm glad you're doing better.",32
Sokka,Then to Ba Sing Se we go. No more distractions.,32
Than,"Hello there, fellow refugees!",32
Aang,"So, you guys are headed to Ba Sing Se, too?",32
Than,Sure are. We're trying to get there before my wife Ying has her baby.,32
Katara,Great! We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.,32
Ying,The Serpent's Pass? Only the truly desperate take that deadly route!,32
Toph,"Deadly route. [  Punches Sokka in the arm.  ] Great pick, Sokka!",32
Sokka,"Well, we are desperate.",32
Than,You should come with us to Full Moon Bay. Ferries take refugees across the lake. It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se.,32
Ying,"And it's hidden, so the Fire Nation can't find it.",32
Katara,Hmm ... peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass?,32
Katara,I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.,32
Than,"We're all looking for a better life, safe behind the walls of Ba Sing Se.",32
Iroh,"Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace ... [  Turns away for a second before turning back with a floral hat on his head.  ] as a tourist!",32
Zuko,"Look around. We're not tourists, we're refugees. [  Sips food and spits it out.  ] Ugh! I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt. I'm tired of living like this!",32
Jet,"Aren't we all? My name's Jet and these are my Freedom Fighters, Smellerbee and Longshot.",32
Smellerbee,Hey. [  Longshot nods.  ],32
Zuko,Hello.,32
Jet,"Here's the deal. I hear the captain's eating like a king while the refugees have to feed off his scraps. Doesn't seem fair, does it?",32
Iroh,What sort of king is he eating like?,32
Jet,"The fat, happy kind. [  At this, Iroh's mouth hangs open as he starts to drool.  ] You want to help us ""liberate"" some food?",32
Zuko,[  Tosses the bowl of rotten food into the water.  ] I'm in.,32
Ticket lady,I told you already ... no vegetables on the ferry! One cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se! Security!,32
Cabbage merchant,Ahhh! My cabbages! [  He is carried away.  ],32
Ticket lady,Next!,32
Aang,"Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.",32
Ticket lady,Passports?,32
Aang,Uh ... no one told us we had to have passports.,32
Sokka,Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar!,32
Ticket lady,"Ah, I see fifty Avatars a day and, by the way, not a very impressive costume. [  The screen pans to show several impostors; notices Momo.  ] Besides, no animals allowed. Do I need to call security?",32
Aang,That won't be necessary.,32
Ticket lady,Next!,32
Toph,"I'll take care of this. My name is Toph Beifong, and I'll need four tickets. [  Presents her passport.  ]",32
Ticket lady,"Ah, the golden seal of the flying boar! It is my pleasure to help anyone of the Beifong family.",32
Toph,"It  is  your pleasure. As you can see, I am blind and these three imbeciles are my valets. [  Sweeps her arm behind her, presenting her friends to the hesitant clerk.  ]",32
Ticket lady,"But, the animal-",32
Toph,-is my seeing-eye lemur.,32
Ticket lady,"Well, normally it's only one ticket per passport, but this document is so official ... I guess it's worth four tickets. [  Stamps an approval seal on the tickets.  ]",32
Toph,Thank you very much.,32
Sokka,"All right, we scammed that lady good!",32
Suki,Tickets and passports please.,32
Sokka,Is there a problem?,32
Suki,"Yeah, I got a problem with you! I've seen your type before. Probably sarcastic, think you're hilarious and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.",32
Sokka,Do I know you?,32
Suki,You mean you don't remember? Maybe you'll remember this! [  Kisses Sokka on the cheek.  ],32
Sokka,Suki! [  Embraces her.  ],32
Suki,"Sokka, it's good to see you!",32
Katara,You look so different without your makeup! And the new outfit.,32
Suki,"That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them. And look at you, sleeveless guy. Been working out?",32
Sokka,"Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing major.",32
Aang,Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around?,32
Suki,"Yeah. After you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up escorting some refugees and we've been here ever since. [  Momo jumps up next to her.  ] Hi, Momo! Good to see you too! [  Scratches his head near his ear.  ] So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry? Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?",32
Katara,Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.,32
Suki,I'm so sorry to hear that. [  To Aang.  ] Are you doing okay?,32
Aang,I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me?,32
Ying,"Avatar Aang, you have to help us! Someone took all of our belongings; our passports, our tickets, everything's gone!",32
Aang,I'll talk to the lady for you.,32
Ticket lady,"No passports, no tickets! [  Stamps a ""denied"" stamp on Aang's forehead.  ]",32
Aang,But she's pregnant and all of her stuff was stolen! You have to make an exception!,32
Ticket lady,"No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy-nilly to anyone, there would be no more order! You know what that means, no more civilization!",32
Aang,What if we gave them our tickets?,32
Ticket lady,No!,32
Aang,But ...,32
Ticket lady,Next!,32
Aang,"Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass.",32
Sokka,I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.,32
Toph,I can't believe you're still complaining about it.,32
Suki,[  In her normal Kyoshi Warrior attire.  ] I'm coming too!,32
Sokka,Are you sure that's a good idea?,32
Suki,"Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come.",32
Sokka,"I do, it's just–",32
Suki,Just what?,32
Sokka,Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.,32
Sokka,"This is the Serpent's Pass? I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent. Huh, I guess they misnamed it.",32
Ying,Look at this writing! How awful!,32
Toph,What does it say?,32
Katara,"It says, ""abandon hope"".",32
Ying,How can we abandon hope? It's all we have!,32
Aang,"I don't know. The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it.",32
Katara,What are you talking about?,32
Aang,Hope is not going to get us into Ba Sing Se and it's not going to help find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now and that's getting across this path.,32
Katara,"Okay, if you say so.",32
Suki,The Fire Nation controls the western lake. Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other side of it and don't want anyone to find out what it is.,32
Than,"I'm okay! [  The rock falls to the water, which the Fire Nation ship notices. It fires.  ]",32
Sokka,"They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go!",32
Sokka,"Suki, are you okay? You have to be more careful! Come on!",32
Toph,"[  Pretending to be Sokka.  ] ""Thanks for saving my life, Toph."" Hey, no problem, Sokka.",32
Sokka,"Suki, you shouldn't sleep there. Who knows how stable this ledge is, it could give away at any moment! [  Moves her sleeping bag.  ]",32
Suki,"Sokka, I'm fine, stop worrying!",32
Sokka,"You're right, you're right, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself! Wait! Oh, never mind, I thought I saw a spider, but, you're fine.",32
Smellerbee,Guard's coming!,32
Katara,"You know, it's okay to miss Appa. [  Aang remains silent.  ] What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all.",32
Aang,You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that.,32
Katara,"But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring. [  Holds out her arms.  ] Come on, you need a hug.",32
Aang,"[  Bows before her.  ] Thank you for your concern, Katara. [  Exits.  ]",32
Suki,It's a beautiful moon.,32
Sokka,"Yeah, it really is.",32
Suki,"Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself.",32
Sokka,I know you can.,32
Suki,Then why are you acting so overprotective?,32
Sokka,It's so hard to lose someone you care about. Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.,32
Suki,"I lost someone I care about. He didn't die, he just went away. I only had a few days to get to know him, but he was smart and brave and funny ...",32
Sokka,[  Jealous.  ] Who is this guy? Is he taller than me?,32
Suki,"No, he's about your height.",32
Sokka,Is he better-looking?,32
Suki,"It  is  you, stupid!",32
Sokka,Oh!,32
Sokka,I can't.,32
Suki,I'm sorry.,32
Sokka,"No, you shouldn't be. [  Exits.  ]",32
Iroh,"So, Smellerbee. That's an unusual name for a young man.",32
Smellerbee,Maybe it's because I'm not a man ... I'm a girl! [  Walks away.  ],32
Iroh,"[  Calling out to her.  ] Oh, now I see. It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!",32
Smellerbee,"I know, you're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think. Thanks, Longshot.",32
Jet,"From what I heard, people eat like this every night in Ba Sing Se. I can't wait to set my eyes on that giant wall.",32
Iroh,It is a magnificent sight.,32
Jet,So you've been there before?,32
Iroh,Once. When I was a ... different man.,32
Jet,"I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of, but that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se: for a new beginning. A second chance.",32
Iroh,That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances.,32
Katara,"Everyone single file! [  She divides the water, allowing everyone to walk through the drowned out path.  ] Aang, I need help! [  Aang helps by creating an air bubble.  ]",32
Katara,What is that thing?,32
Sokka,"I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass! Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away!",32
Suki,Just because I live near the unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert!,32
Sokka,"[  Holds up Momo.  ] Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you.",32
Katara,Sokka!,32
Aang,"[  Blasts the Serpent back with a burst of air.  ] I'll distract it. Katara, get everyone across! [  Takes off on his glider.  ]",32
Sokka,"Toph, come on, it's just ice!",32
Toph,"[  Feels the ice but her sense of sight is restricted.  ] Actually, I'm going to stay on my little island, where I can see! [  The serpent takes out half the island.  ] Okay, I'm coming! [  Slowly crosses the ice.  ]",32
Sokka,You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice!,32
Toph,It's hard to ignore.,32
Sokka,You're almost there!,32
Toph,Help! I can't swim!,32
Sokka,"I'm coming, Toph!",32
Toph,Help!,32
Toph,"[  Thinking it is Sokka.  ] Oh Sokka, you saved me! [  Kisses Suki on the cheek.  ]",32
Suki,"Actually, it's me.",32
Toph,Oh ... well ... [  Chuckles. Embarrassed.  ] you can go ahead and let me drown now.,32
Sokka,There's the wall! Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.,32
Ying,[  Groans in pain.  ] Oh no!,32
Sokka,What's wrong?,32
Ying,The baby's coming!,32
Sokka,[  Panicked.  ] What? Now? Can't you hold it in or something?,32
Katara,"Sokka, calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home.",32
Sokka,This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real ... human ... thing!,32
Katara,"It's called a baby and I helped her deliver plenty of those, too. Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water. Toph, I need you to make an earth tent, a big one. [  Toph earthbends the rock to form a tent.  ] Suki, come with me.",32
Jet,"You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were. You're an outcast, like me. And us outcasts have to stick together. We have to watch each other's backs. Because no one else will.",32
Zuko,I've realized lately that being on your own isn't always the best path.,32
Katara,"You're doing great, Ying. Sokka, where's that water? Now get ready to push. One ... two ... [  Sokka enters.  ] ... three, push!",32
Katara,[  From inside the tent.  ] It's a girl!,32
Toph,"So, you want to go see the baby, or are you going to faint like an old lady again?",32
Sokka,"No, no, I'm good this time. [  Toph and Sokka enter the tent.  ]",32
Katara,"Aang, you have to come see this.",32
Toph,She sounds healthy.,32
Katara,She's beautiful.,32
Sokka,It's so ... squishy looking.,32
Than,What should we name her?,32
Ying,I want our daughter's name to be unique. I want it to mean something.,32
Aang,[  Sheds some tears.  ] I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me ... hopeful again.,32
Ying,I know what I want to name our baby now. Hope.,32
Than,That's a perfect name. Hope.,32
Aang,"I thought I was trying to be strong. But really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you.",32
Aang,"I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can. I just really need to do this.",32
Sokka,See you in the big city.,32
Toph,Say hi to that big fuzzball for me. [  Punches Aang in the arm.  ],32
Katara,"You'll find him, Aang.",32
Aang,"I know. Thank you, Katara. You ready, Momo? [  Aang and Momo fly off. The rest wave goodbye.  ]",32
Suki,"Sokka, it's been really great to see you again.",32
Sokka,"Whoa, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?",32
Suki,I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the Serpent's Pass safely. But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi Warriors.,32
Sokka,So you came along to protect me?,32
Suki,"Listen, I'm really sorry about last night. We were talking ... and saying things ... and I just got carried away and before I knew it -",32
Sokka,[  Kisses Suki.  ] You talk too much.,32
Aang,"Sorry Momo, Appa's going to have to wait.",32
Qin,"This drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power. Once it tunnels through the wall, our troops will storm their city. The Earth Kingdom will finally fall, and you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father. Nothing can stop us.",33
Ty Lee,"[  Looking through the telescope.  ] Hmmm, what about those muscle-y guys down there?",33
Qin,[  Strikes the periscope roughly alarming Ty Lee.  ] Please. The drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack.,33
Azula,"Oh, I'm sure it is, War Minister Qin, but just to be on the safe side ... [  Sharply while looking at the two girls.  ] Mai and Ty Lee, take the earthbenders out!",33
Mai,"[  Swinging a knife around her finger; relieved.  ] Finally, something to do. [  Rises and walks out.  ]",33
Katara,"[  Surprised.  ] Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa.",33
Aang,"I was, but something stopped me. Something big.",33
Sokka,Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?,33
Aang,[  Camera zooms out to drill.  ] That.,33
Ying,[  Despairingly.  ] We made it to Ba Sing Se and we're still not safe. No one is! [  Huddles with family members.  ],33
Earthbender guard,What are you people doing here? Civilians aren't allowed on the wall!,33
Aang,I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever is in charge.,33
General Sung,"[  Happily.  ] It is an honor to welcome you to the Outer Wall, young Avatar, but your help is not needed.",33
Aang,Not needed?,33
General Sung,"[  Calmly.  ]  Not  needed. I have the situation under control. I assure you the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall. Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded.",33
Toph,What about the Dragon of the West? He got in.,33
General Sung,"[  Slightly taken aback.  ] Well ... uh, technically yes, but he was quickly expunged. [  Confidently.  ] Nevertheless, that is why the city is named Ba Sing Se. It's the ""impenetrable city"". They don't call it Na Sing Se. [  Laughs, but subsequently turns serious.  ] That means ""penetrable city.""",33
Toph,"Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem.",33
General Sung,"Not for long. To stop it, I've sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Terra Team.",33
Sokka,That's a good group name. Very catchy.,33
Terra Team leader,Ready ... attack!,33
General Sung,[  Upon witnessing the defeat of the Terra Team.  ] We're doomed! [  Flails arms in panic.  ],33
Sokka,"[  Slaps him across the face.  ] Get a hold of yourself, man!",33
General Sung,[  Rubbing cheek.  ] You're right. I'm sorry.,33
Toph,Maybe you'd like the Avatar's help  now  ?,33
General Sung,"[  Meekly stands before the Avatar. Humbly.  ] Yes, please.",33
Aang,"The question is, how are we going to stop that thing? [  All turn their heads to Sokka.  ]",33
Sokka,Why are you all looking at me?,33
Aang,You're the idea guy.,33
Sokka,[  Complaining.  ] So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure.,33
Katara,And also the complaining guy.,33
Sokka,That part I don't mind.,33
Ticket woman,"So, Mr. Lee and Mr. ummm ... Mushy, is it?",33
Iroh,It's pronounced Mushi.,33
Ticket woman,[  Annoyed.  ] You telling me how to do my job?,33
Iroh,"[  Approaches the ticket booth.  ] Uh, no, no. But may I just say you're like a flower in bloom. Your beauty is intoxicating.",33
Ticket woman,"[  Flirtatiously.  ] You're pretty easy on the eyes yourself, handsome. Raorr! Welcome to Ba Sing Se. [  Stamps their tickets.  ]",33
Zuko,[  Disgusted.  ] I'm going to forget I saw that. [  Grabs ticket and walks away.  ],33
Jet,"I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter. He's just trying to find his way in the world, like us.",33
Smellerbee,"You don't know anything about him, Jet.",33
Jet,I know he didn't get that scar from a waterbender.,33
Smellerbee,"Besides, I thought we were going straight now.",33
Jet,"We are, and the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like Lee. What do you think, Longshot?",33
Jet,I can respect that.,33
General Sung,What's wrong with him? He doesn't look injured.,33
Katara,His chi is blocked. [  Stops healing.  ] Who did this to you?,33
Terra Team member,Two girls ambushed us. One of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs and suddenly I couldn't earthbend anymore and I could barely move. Then she cartwheeled away.,33
Katara,"[  Eyes widen in realization.  ] Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside.",33
Sokka,"[  Excitedly.  ] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Ooh!",33
Katara,Yes?,33
Sokka,What you just said! That's how we're going to take down the drill! The same way Ty Lee took down all those big earthbenders!,33
Toph,By hitting its pressure points!,33
Aang,[  Looking out over the wall with a determined look.  ] We'll take it down from the inside.,33
Toph,"[  Gesturing toward the drill.  ] Once I whip up some cover, you're not going to be able to see. So, stay close to me.",33
Toph,Run!,33
Ty Lee,"Hey, look at that dust cloud. [  Periscope view shows front of drill and billowing cloud.  ] It's so ... poofy. [  Cut back to Ty Lee who looks away from the periscope with a spaced-out expression.  ] Poof.",33
Qin,"Don't worry, Princess. I'm sure it's nothing. [  Azula casts a doubtful look.  ]",33
Toph,Everyone into the hole!,33
Sokka,"It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing!",33
Toph,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Oh no, what a nightmare!",33
Sokka,[  Sheepishly.  ] Sorry.,33
Sokka,There!,33
Sokka,"Toph, come on!",33
Toph,No way am I going in that metal monster. I can't bend in there. I'll try to slow it down out here.,33
Sokka,"Okay, good luck! [  He and Aang disappear into the drill.  ]",33
Sokka,I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find its weak points.,33
Aang,Where are we going to get something like that? [  Sokka unexpectedly cuts off a steam valve with his machete.  ] What are you doing? Someone's going to hear us!,33
Sokka,That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it. And when something breaks ...,33
Katara,They come to fix it!,33
Katara,[  Appears behind him.  ] Hi.,33
Sokka,This'll work. Thanks!,33
Sokka,"It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures. There's the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell. The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse.",33
Jet,"So, you guys got plans once you're inside the city?",33
Tea seller,Get your hot tea here! Finest tea in Ba Sing Se!,33
Iroh,[  Waves hand.  ] Ooh! Jasmine please.,33
Iroh,"Blaugh! Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it! What a disgrace!",33
Jet,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?",33
Jet,You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together. You want to join the Freedom Fighters?,33
Zuko,"Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.",33
Jet,"Come on, we made a great team looting that captain's food. Think of all the good we could do for these refugees.",33
Zuko,[  Walking away.  ] I said no.,33
Jet,Have it your way.,33
Iroh,Hey!,33
Zuko,"[  Gritting in a whisper.  ] What are you doing firebending your tea? For a wise, old man, that was a pretty stupid move!",33
Iroh,"[  Mourning.  ] I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ... [  Sniffs. The cup is shown overturned in a puddle.  ] it's just so sad!",33
Sokka,"Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.",33
Katara,"[  Crosses her arms.  ] What's this ""we"" stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.",33
Sokka,"[  Turns and gestures to self.  ] Look, I'm the plan guy. You two [  Makes rapid chop-chop gestures.  ] are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys. [  Strikes a heroic pose.  ] Together, we're Team Avatar!",33
Sokka,[  Pumping arms in the air.  ] C'mon team. Don't quit now. [  Katara grinds her teeth as she seethes with rage.  ] We're ...,33
Katara,[  Explodes with frustration.  ] Grrr!,33
Sokka,"I mean, [  Recovers and points reassuringly.  ] you're almost there.",33
Katara,"[  Panting in exhaustion.  ] At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall.",33
Aang,I don't know how many more of those I have in me.,33
Sokka,Do you hear that? We took it down! We better get out of here fast!,33
Qin,"Congratulations, crew. The drill has made contact with the wall of Ba Sing Se. [  Cuts to him standing in the command module.  ] Start the countdown to victory!",33
Sokka,[  Pushing against brace.  ] C'mon brace ... budge! [  Makes several more attempts to move it.  ],33
Katara,"This is bad,  really  bad.",33
Sokka,"We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!",33
Aang,"[  Struck with realization.  ] Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike. [  Rises.  ] Sokka, take a fighting stance. You've got to be quick and accurate. Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance. [  Strikes Sokka several times.  ] And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow. [  Hits him softly on the head.  ] His own weight becomes his downfall, literally.",33
Katara,"So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through.",33
Aang,Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow.,33
Sokka,[  Rising.  ] And boom! It all comes crashing down!,33
Aang,Everyone inside that wall. The whole world is counting on us.,33
Sokka,The whole world minus the Fire Nation that is.,33
Toph,"[  Straining as the drill continues to push her back.  ] C'mon, Twinkle Toes, hurry up!",33
Aang,That's enough! We need to get to the next one!,33
Engineer,"War Minister, an engineer was ambushed! His schematics were stolen!",33
Second Engineer,"War Minister, a brace on the starboard side has been cut clean through! It's sabotage, sir!",33
Azula,"[  Sharply.  ] Let's go, ladies!",33
Sokka,"Good work, Team Avatar! Now Aang just needs to ... [  Glances up in horror.  ] duck!",33
Aang,[  Barely misses another fire blast.  ] Whoa!,33
Ty Lee,"Wow, Azula, you were right! It  is  the Avatar! [  Cut to a close-up of Ty Lee; she smiles flirtatiously at Sokka.  ] ... and friends.",33
Sokka,[  Smiles and waves.  ] Hey.,33
Aang,"Guys, get out of here. I know what I need to do.",33
Katara,Wait. [  Throws him her water skin.  ] You need this water more than I do!,33
Azula,Follow them! The Avatar's mine!,33
Katara,"[  Reads a sign nearby, while Sokka struggles to open the hatch.  ] Slurry pipeline? What does that mean?",33
Sokka,[  Having successfully opened hatch which leads to a canal channeling slurry.  ] It's rock and water mixed together. It means our way out!,33
Mai,"[  Holds her hands over the slurry.  ] Ugh, disgusting!",33
Ty Lee,C'mon! You heard Azula. We have to follow them!,33
Mai,She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me. I am not going in that wall sludge juice. [  Shivers in disgust.  ],33
Katara,"[  Hatefully and tauntingly.  ] Why don't you try blocking my chi now, circus freak?",33
Sokka,"Katara, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill. Then when Aang delivers the final blow, it'll be ready to pop!",33
Aang,"[  Halting.  ] This looks like a good spot, Momo. [  Looks up to find boulders being hurtled down the wall, nearly crushing him. Yelling.  ] General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!",33
General Sung,"[  Frantically.  ] Soldiers, whatever you do, don't stop shooting rocks down there!",33
Sokka,"Good technique, little sister! Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe!",33
Katara,"[  Irritated.  ] You know, I'm just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day! You're like a chattering hog-monkey!",33
Sokka,"[  Screaming.  ] Just bend the slurry, woman!",33
Toph,[  Approaching Katara.  ] You guys need some help?,33
Katara,"Toph, help me plug up this drain.",33
Aang,[  Exhausted.  ] What I'd give to be a metalbender.,33
Aang,"[  Assuming a fighting stance.  ] Momo, get out of here!",33
Aang,"Thanks, Momo. I owe you one. [  Runs over to the wedge he sliced in the drill.  ] Now all I need ... [  A boulder falls before him.  ] Actually, that is what I need for once.",33
Sokka,Woohoo!,33
Toph,Here it comes!,33
Mai,[  Dryly.  ] We lost.,33
Train conductor,Last call for Ba Sing Se!,33
Smellerbee,"Jet, relax. So the old guy had some hot tea. Big deal.",33
Jet,He heated it himself! [  Darkly.  ] Those guys are  firebenders  !,33
Iroh,What a handsome baby. [  Strokes the infant.  ],33
Ying,Thank you.,33
Sokka,"I just want to say, good effort out there today, Team Avatar!",33
Katara,"[  Unamused.  ] Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter how many times you say it, it's not going to catch on.",33
Sokka,"How about ... [  Pulls out boomerang.  ] the Boomeraang Squad! See it's good because it's got ""Aang"" in it. Boomer  aang  .",33
Aang,[  Grins.  ] I kind of like that one.,33
Katara,[  Begins walking away.  ] Let's talk about this on our way into the city.,33
Sokka,The Aang Gang?,33
Katara,Sokka ...,33
Sokka,The Fearsome Foursome?,33
Toph,[  Also walking away.  ] You're crazy.,33
Sokka,Why? We're fearsome!,33
Katara,"[  Excitedly.  ] Look, the Inner Wall! [  Cut to a shot of the monorail approaching the wall. Cut back inside monorail.  ] I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.",34
Sokka,"[  Slightly skeptically.  ] Hey, don't jinx it! We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp!",34
Toph,"[  Slightly annoyed, yet still jokingly.  ] You been hitting the cactus juice again?",34
Sokka,"I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.",34
Katara,"[  Sympathetically.  ] Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa.",34
Aang,[  Doubtfully.  ] It's such a big city.,34
Sokka,[  Somewhat optimistically.  ] He's a giant bison! Where could someone possibly hide him?,34
Sokka,[  Realizing the city's gigantic size.  ] Oh.,34
Toph,[  Sighs.  ] Back in the city. Great.,34
Sokka,[  Excitedly.  ] What's the problem? It's amazing!,34
Toph,"[  Shot shows Sokka and Toph with Momo resting on her shoulder.  ] It's just a bunch of walls and rules. You wait, you'll get sick of it in a couple of days.",34
Aang,"I'm comin' for ya, buddy. [  Katara walks over to the downtrodden Aang, and places her hand on his shoulder. More confidently.  ] He's here; I can feel it.",34
Joo Dee,"[  Excited.  ] Hello, my name is Joo Dee! I have been given the great honor of showing the Avatar around Ba Sing Se. And you must be Sokka, Katara, and Toph! Welcome to our wonderful city. Shall we get started?",34
Sokka,"Yes. We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King, immediately.",34
Joo Dee,Great! Let's begin our tour. And then I'll show you to your new home here. I think you'll like it!,34
Sokka,"[  Slightly annoyed.  ] Ugh! [  Walks up to Joo Dee.  ] Maybe you missed what I said. We need to talk to the king about the War, it's important.",34
Joo Dee,[  Close-up on Joo Dee's face.  ] You're in Ba Sing Se now. Everyone is safe here.,34
Joo Dee,This is the Lower Ring.,34
Katara,What's that wall for?,34
Joo Dee,"Oh, Ba Sing Se has many walls! There are the ones outside protecting us, and the ones inside, that help maintain order. [  Shot changes to outside the carriage as the camera pans across some refugees.  ] This is where our newest arrivals live, as well as our craftsman and artisans, people that work with their hands. [  Shot changes back to inside the carriage.  ] It's so quaint and lively!",34
Joo Dee,"[  Nervously.  ] You do want to watch your step, though.",34
Katara,[  Nervous look on her face.  ] Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city?,34
Aang,[  Upset and somewhat bored.  ] This is why I never came here before. I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live. [  Looks out the window.  ],34
Iroh,"I just want our place to look nice, in case someone brings home a lady friend! [  He gives Zuko a nudge with the elbow.  ]",34
Zuko,[  Bleakly.  ] This city is a prison. I don't want to make a life here.,34
Iroh,"Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not. Now come on, I found us some new jobs, and we start this afternoon!",34
Jet,"Look at them, firebenders living right under everyone's nose.",34
Smellerbee,"Jet, you saw a man with a hot cup of tea. It doesn't prove he's a firebender. And what if he is, are we supposed to attack them‌? I thought we were starting over here, changing our ways.",34
Jet,"We are. When I get the evidence I need, I'll report them to the police and let them handle it. [  Walks forward a bit and turns his head to face the pair.  ] Ok‌ay?",34
Joo Dee,"This is the Middle Ring of Ba Sing Se, home to the financial district, shops and restaurants, and the university.",34
Sokka,"Yeah, we met a professor from the Ba Sing Se University. He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is [  Cut to inside carriage. Leaning toward Joo Dee, losing his patience.  ]  absolutely crucial for the Earth King to hear  !",34
Joo Dee,"[  Smiling; excitedly.  ] Isn't history fascinating? Look, here's one of the oldest buildings in the Middle Ring, Town Hall!",34
Sokka,Is that woman deaf? She only seems to hear every other word I say.,34
Toph,"It's called ""being handled"". Get used to it. [  Crosses her arms as everyone else glares sadly at Sokka.  ]",34
Pao,"Well, you certainly look like official tea servers. [  Cut to close-up of Pao.  ] How do you feel‌?",34
Zuko,[  Annoyed.  ] Ridiculous.,34
Iroh,"Uh, does this possibly come in a larger size? [  Cut to a view behind Iroh with the apron strings not quite long enough to tie.  ]",34
Pao,I have extra string in the back. Have some tea while you wait!,34
Iroh,[  Quickly holds the cup at a distance.  ] Blech! [  Looks at it in disgust.  ] This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!,34
Zuko,"[  Iroh closely examines his cup. In an annoyed tone.  ] Uncle, that's what  all  tea is.",34
Iroh,[  Angrily.  ] How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?! We'll have to make some major changes around here.,34
Joo Dee,The Upper Ring is home to our most important citizens. Your house is not too far from here!,34
Katara,[  Close-up.  ] What's inside that wall?,34
Sokka,And who're the mean-looking guys in robes?,34
Joo Dee,"Inside is the Royal Palace. Those men are agents of the Dai Li, the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se. They are the guardians of all our traditions!",34
Aang,[  Close-up view. Bored and annoyed.  ] Can we see the king now?,34
Joo Dee,"[  Close-up view.  ] Oh no, one doesn't just pop in on the Earth King!",34
Joo Dee,Here we are! Your new home.,34
Joo Dee,"[  Close-up view.  ] More good news! Your request for an audience with the Earth King is being processed, and should be put through in about month. [  Cut to behind the gang looking down at Joo Dee.  ] Much more quickly than usual!",34
Sokka,[  Close-up view of Team Avatar. Surprised.  ] A month?,34
Joo Dee,"[  Close-up view. Smiling widely.  ] Six to eight weeks, actually. [  Closes her eyes and grins.  ]",34
Joo Dee,[  Close-up side-view.  ] Isn't it nice? I think you'll really enjoy it here.,34
Sokka,[  Cut to view of entire room from the back.  ] I think we would enjoy it more if we weren't staying for so long. Can't we see the Earth King  any  sooner?,34
Joo Dee,"[  Close-up view over Sokka's shoulder. Smiling.  ] The Earth King is very busy running the finest city in the world! [  Close-up on Sokka, as an annoyed expression covers his face.  ] But he will see you as soon as time permits.",34
Aang,"[  Cut to Momo and Aang. Aang turns to look out the window determined.  ] If we're going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa. [  At the sound of Appa's name, Momo wakes up.  ]",34
Joo Dee,[  Side-view of Aang with Joo Dee behind. Bows.  ] I'd like to escort you anywhere you'd like to go.,34
Toph,[  Cut to Katara and Toph. Annoyed.  ] We don't  need  a babysitter.,34
Joo Dee,"Oh, I won't get in the way. [  She takes a step, blocking Toph's path.  ] And to leave you alone would make me a bad host! [  Close-up of Toph, from behind, with Joo Dee in front.  ] Where shall we start?",34
Pet store owner,"[  Close-up shot.  ] I'm sorry, but I haven't heard anything about a flying bison. I didn't even know there  were  any.",34
Aang,"[  Cut to shot of Aang and Sokka, Joo Dee lurking behind.  ] If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal without anyone knowing, where would they go‌?",34
Sokka,"[  Slightly frustrated.  ] Where's the black market? Who runs it? [  Pointing at him accusingly.  ] Come on, you know!",34
Pet store owner,"[  Close-up shot. Nervous and perspiring.  ] Uh ... [  Looks at Joo Dee, who is standing behind Sokka and Aang, shaking her head.  ] That would be illegal. You'll have to leave now; your lemur is harassing my sparrowkeets.",34
University student,"Hmm ... I've never seen any sandbenders or nomads around here. [  Frontal shot.  ] You should ask Professor Zei, he teaches the class on desert cultures.",34
Sokka,[  Annoyed.  ]  Right  . And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?,34
University student,[  Nervously.  ] Uh ...,34
University student,[  Close-up shot. Still very nervous.  ] I don't know. I'm not a political science student ... I've got to get to class.,34
Joo Dee,"Well, I'm sorry no one has seen your bison. Why don't you go get some rest‌? [  Smiling.  ] Someone will be over with dinner, later.",34
Sokka,"[  He gestures to the rest of Team Avatar to follow him.  ] Hey, come with me.",34
Pong,You're the Avatar! [  Side-view of gang.  ] I heard you were in town. [  Overhead view.  ] I'm Pong.,34
Aang,"[  Side-view of gang. Smiles.  ] Nice to meet you, Pong.",34
Sokka,"So, Pong, what's goin' on with this city? Why is everyone here so scared here to talk about the war?",34
Pong,[  Frontal view. Shifts his eyes to the sides.  ] War? Scared? What do you mean?,34
Toph,[  Frontal view. Slightly annoyed.  ] I can feel you shaking.,34
Pong,"[  Frontal view.  ] Look, I'm just a minor government official. [  Looks to the sides to confirm that no one is present except them.  ] I've waited three years to get this house. I don't want go get into trouble.",34
Katara,[  Tight side-view of the gang and Pong.  ] Get in trouble with who?!,34
Pong,"[  Puts his finger on his mouth, and whispers.  ] Shh, listen, you can't mention the War here. [  Overhead view.  ] And whatever you do, stay away from the Dai Li.",34
Iroh,Would you like a pot of tea?,34
Zuko,[  Close-up of Jet.  ] We've been working in a tea shop all day! [  View from the outside in to the window where Zuko lays on a bed.  ] I'm  sick  of tea!,34
Iroh,"[  Pan across to Iroh through another window.  ] ""Sick of tea?"" That's like being sick of breathing! [  He rummages through the cupboard beneath the counter, where he is standing. Close-up view of kettle.  ] Have you seen the spark rocks to heat up the water?",34
Jet,"[  Side-view. Whispering to himself.  ] They're not there. [  Opens his fist to show some emerald colored rocks. Close-up side-view.  ] You'll have to firebend, old man. [  He sees Iroh going inside, and narrows his eyes.  ] Where're you going?",34
Iroh,[  View through window. Coming back to the counter.  ] I borrowed our neighbors'. Such kind people.,34
Katara,I got it! I know how we're going to see the Earth King!,34
Toph,"[  Frontal view.  ] How are we supposed to do that? [  Mimicking Joo Dee.  ] ""One doesn't just  pop  in on the Earth King!""",34
Katara,[  Side-view of her and Aang. Reading from the papers.  ] The king is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear.,34
Aang,"You mean, platypus bear?",34
Katara,"No, it just says 'bear'.",34
Sokka,[  Close-up view. He is lying upside down.  ] Certainly you mean his pet skunk bear.,34
Toph,[  Frontal view.  ] Or his armadillo bear.,34
Aang,[  Frontal view.  ] Gopher bear?,34
Katara,[  Side-view of room.  ] Just ... bear.,34
Toph,This place ... is weird.,34
Katara,[  Growing excited again.  ] The palace will be packed. We can sneak in with the crowd!,34
Toph,[  Lies down.  ] Won't work.,34
Katara,[  Frontal view. Slightly confused.  ] Why not?,34
Toph,"[  Over Katara's shoulder view.  ] Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd will spot you a mile away. You've got no manners! [  Takes a pastry from a bowl and eats it.  ]",34
Katara,"[  Frontal view.  ] Excuse me?  I've  got no manners?! You're not exactly ""lady fancy fingers!""",34
Toph,"[  Burps. Over Katara's shoulder view.  ] I learned proper society behavior and  chose  to leave it. [  Throws the half eaten pastry to the side.  ] You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late. [  She picks her nose and flicks the snot off her finger.  ]",34
Sokka,"[  Side-view of room. Excitedly.  ] Aha, but you learned it! You could teach us!",34
Aang,"Yeah, I'm mastering every element. How hard could manners be‌?",34
Aang,"Good evening, Mr. Sokka Water Tribe, Ms. Katara Water Tribe, Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty. Your Momo-ness. [  Frontal view of Momo as he peeks at Aang from under the carpet and slightly bows.  ]",34
Sokka,"[  Stands up also wearing a curtain like a robe. Mimicking a typical high class person.  ] Avatar Aang, how do you do? Go on.",34
Toph,"Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys!",34
Sokka,But I feel so fancy! [  Toph's snot falls on Sokka's forehead.  ],34
Aang,[  Closing his hands into a fist.  ] Earth!,34
Sokka,[  Wriggling his hands.  ] Fire!,34
Aang,"[  Stunned.  ] Wow, you look beautiful.",34
Toph,"Don't talk to the commoners, Katara. First rule of society.",34
Katara,"[  To Sokka and Aang.  ] We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate.",34
Smellerbee,"Jet, we need to talk.",34
Jet,"What‌? Oh great, it's you guys. Where have you been‌? [  Overhead view of alley.  ] I could use some help with surveillance here!",34
Smellerbee,"We've been talking, [  Cut to side-view of the threesome, tea shop in background.  ] and we think you're becoming obsessed with this. It's not healthy.",34
Jet,"[  Close-up shot.  ] Oh, really? You both think this?",34
Smellerbee,We came here to make a fresh start. But you won't let this go. Even though there is no real proof!,34
Jet,"Well, maybe if you'd help me!",34
Smellerbee,"[  Side-view of threesome.  ] Jet, you gotta stop this.",34
Jet,"Maybe you've forgotten why we need to start over. [  View of Longshot and Smellerbee from behind Jet. Longshot and Smellerbee look down, guiltily.  ] Maybe you've forgotten about how the Fire Nation left us all homeless‌. How they wiped out all the people we loved. If you don't want to help me, I'll get the evidence on my own. [  He goes toward the tea shop.  ]",34
Customer,This is the best tea in the city!,34

Pao,[  Side-view. Turning to Iroh.  ] I think you're due for a raise.,34
Jet,I'm tired of waiting! [  Pointing an accusing finger at Iroh and Zuko.  ] These two men are firebenders!,34
Jet,"I know they're firebenders, I saw the old man heating his tea!",34
Customer,[  Frontal view. Bleakly.  ] He works in a tea shop.,34
Jet,[  Frontal view.  ] He's a firebender! I'm  telling  you!,34
Customer,"[  Frontal view. Stands up, along with another man.  ] Drop your swords, boy. Nice and easy.",34
Jet,"[  Frontal view. To Zuko.  ] You'll have to defend yourself. Then everyone will know. Go ahead, show them what you can do.",34
Zuko,You want a show? I'll give you a show!,34
Guard,Invitation please.,34
Toph,[  Formally.  ] I think this will do.,34
Guard,"No entry without an invitation. Step out of line, please.",34
Toph,"[  Irritated.  ] Look, the Pangs and the Yum Soon Hans are waiting in there for us! I'm going to have to tell them  who  didn't let me in.",34
Guard,[  Unyielding.  ] Step out of line please.,34
Katara,"[  Side-view.  ] Sir, I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations. [  Whispering.  ] She's blind. [  Again, normally.  ] Do you think you could help us? Our family's inside and I'm sure they're  very  worried.",34
Long Feng,"[  Close-up view as he smiles and bows his head.  ] I am honored, please come with me.",34
Older guest,He's taking all the good stuff!,34
Younger guest,Quiet! You don't know what I had to do to get seats  this  near the bear!,34
Long Feng,"It's beautiful, isn't it? [  Close-up shot. Turning to the girls.  ] By the way, I'm Long Feng. I'm a cultural minister to the king.",34
Katara,"[  View of her and Toph.  ] I'm Kwa Mai, and this is ... Dum. [  Toph frowns and pulls a string hanging from Katara's headdress, causing her pain.  ] Ow!",34
Long Feng,[  Close-up shot.  ] Now where is your family? I'd  love  to meet them.,34
Katara,"[  Side-view. Feigning looking around.  ] Uh ... I don't see them right now, but I'm sure we'll find them soon. [  Smiles.  ] Thanks for all your help.",34
Long Feng,"Don't worry, as your escort it would be dishonorable to abandon you ladies without finding your family first. We'll keep looking. [  He turns around and leads the two girls, while Katara glances at Toph, nervously.  ]",34
Aang,[  Worried and nervous.  ] Where are they?,34
Sokka,"Look, I came up with a back-up plan. [  He picks Momo up.  ] We dress Momo like a ghost, okay? [  Moves Momo in a circle.  ] He flies by the guards, creating a distraction. Then, we blast a hole in the wall-",34
Aang,Or we could go in as these guys. Toph said we might pass as busboys!,34
Sokka,"Okay ... [  Rolls his eyes.  ] But remember that Momo ghost plan. I think it's a winner. [  Smiling, he and Aang sink behind the pedestal.  ]",34
Jet,[  Close-up shot with a sinister grin.  ] You must be getting tired of using those swords. [  Close-up shot of Zuko with a look of annoyance.  ] Why don't you go ahead and firebend at me?,34

Jet,Bet you wish he'd help you out with a little fire blast right now.,34
Zuko,You're  the one who needs help.,34
Jet,You see that‌?! [  Aerial view.  ] The Fire Nation is trying to silence me. [  View behind Zuko looking at Jet.  ] It'll  never  happen.,34
Aang,[  A little worried.  ] Where are Toph and Katara?,34
Sokka,"Forget about them! Just keep an eye out for the king. [  He grows slightly annoyed as Momo's tail, which has been sticking out of Aang's hat, begins to wag in his face.  ]",34
Aang,[  Slightly nervous.  ] I don't know what he looks like.,34
Sokka,"You know,  royal  , flowing robe, fancy jewelry. [  He grabs Momo's tail, still wagging in his face, and vigorously stuffs it back into Aang's hat.  ]",34
Aang,That could be  anyone  !,34

Sokka,Why won't you let us talk to the king? We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!,34
Long Feng,The Earth King has no time to get involved with political squabbles and the day to day minutia of military activities.,34
Aang,This could be the most important thing he's ever heard.,34
Long Feng,"What's most important to his royal majesty is maintaining the  cultural  heritage of Ba Sing Se. All his duties relate to issuing decrees on such matters. It's  my  job to oversee the rest of the city's resources, including the military.",34
Katara,[  Frontal view.  ] So the king is just a figurehead.,34
Toph,[  Angry.  ] He's your puppet!,34
Long Feng,"[  Frontal view.  ] Oh, no, no. His Majesty is an icon, a god to his people. He can't sully his hands with the hourly change of an endless war.",34
Sokka,[  Side-view of room.  ] But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless. You could lead an invasion ...,34
Long Feng,"[  Stands up, annoyed. Shot changes briefly to a confused Sokka.  ] Enough! I don't want to hear your ridiculous plan. [  Cut back to Long Feng.  ] It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se that the War not be mentioned within the walls. [  Scene changes as he talks to the two Dai Li agents dragging Jet into a dark room, making him sit on a stone chair.  ] Constant news of an escalating war will throw the citizens of Ba Sing Se into a state of panic.",34
Jet,"You have to believe me, they're firebenders! They won't stop until they win the War.",34
Dai Li agent,"[  Frontal view.  ] Calm down, you're safe now.",34
Long Feng,"Our economy would be ruined, our peaceful way of life – our traditions – would disappear.",34
Dai Li agent,There's no war in Ba Sing Se.,34
Jet,What're you talking about? [  Camera changes to an aerial view zooming out.  ] Where do you think all the refugees come from? You can't hide it!,34
Long Feng,"In silencing talk of conflict, Ba Sing Se remains a peaceful, orderly utopia: the last one on Earth.",34
Dai Li agent,"There is no war within the walls. Here we are safe. Here, we are free.",34
Katara,You can't keep the truth from all these people. They  have  to know.,34
Aang,"[  Stepping forward, pointing a finger at Long Feng.  ] I'll tell them! I'll make sure everyone knows!",34
Long Feng,"[  Side-view of room.  ] Until now, you've been treated as our honored guest. [  Cut to side-view of Long Feng and Aang. Long Feng steps forward and bends down to look Aang in the eye. Aang stares back at Long Feng, angrily.  ] But from now on, you will be watched every moment by Dai Li agents. If you mention the War to anyone, you will be expelled from the city. [  He turns around and walks over to the hearth with the green fire.  ] I understand you've been looking for your bison. [  View of Long Feng turning slightly to look at Aang.  ] It would be quite a shame if you were not able to complete your quest. [  Aang appears frightened, but his expression soon changes to that of anger. Cut to an overhead shot of the room. Long Feng sits down, as Joo Dee opens the doors and walks toward the group.  ] Now, Joo Dee will show you to your home.",34
Joo Dee replacement,"Come with me, please.",34
Katara,[  Surprised.  ] What happened to Joo Dee?,34
Joo Dee replacement,I'm Joo Dee. [  Bows her head.  ] I'll be your host as long as you're in our wonderful city.,34
Katara,Toph! Aren't you gonna get ready for the day?,35
Toph,I'm ready.,35
Katara,"You're not gonna wash up? You've got a little dirt on your ... everywhere, actually.",35
Toph,"You call it dirt, I call it a healthy coating of earth!",35
Katara,Hmm ... [  Thinking.  ] You know what we need? A girl's day out!,35
Toph,Do I have to?!,35
Katara,It'll be fun!,35
Toph,The Fancy Lady Day Spa? [  Sarcastically.  ] Sounds like my kinda place.,35
Katara,Are you ready for some  serious  pampering?,35
Toph,"Sure, Katara, whatever you say. As long as they don't touch my feet.",35
Toph,"Well, that wasn't so bad. I'm not usually into that stuff but I actually feel ... girly.",35
Katara,I'm glad. It's about time we did something fun together.,35
Girl with umbrella,"Wow, great make-up.",35
Toph,Thanks.,35
Girl with umbrella,For a clown!,35
Katara,"Don't listen to them, let's just keep walking.",35
Star,I think she looks cute. Like that time we put a sweater on your pet poodle monkey.,35
Third girl,"Good one, Star.",35
Katara,"[  Angrily.  ] Let's go, Toph.",35
Toph,"[  Sarcastically.  ] No, no, that  was  a good one. Like your poodle monkey. [  She laughs.  ] You know what else is a good one? [  She earthbends the bridge, removing a circular part above which the three girls are standing, causing the girls to fall into the creek below. Cut to Katara's face from the hole.  ]",35
Katara,Now  that  was funny.,35
Katara,Those girls don't know what they're talking about.,35
Toph,"It's okay. One of the good things about being blind, is I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearance. [  Cut to a close-up of Toph's face.  ] I don't care what I look like. I'm not looking for anyone's approval. I know who I am. [  She stops walking, and she cries a bit.  ]",35
Katara,"That's what I really admire about you, Toph. You're so strong, and confident, and self-assured. [  Toph sniffs.  ] And I know it doesn't matter, but ... [  Keeps her palm on Toph's shoulder.  ] You're really pretty.",35
Toph,"[  Turning to Katara, smiling.  ] I am?",35
Katara,"Yeah, you are.",35
Toph,"I'd return the compliment, but I've no idea how you look like. [  Katara laughs.  ] Thank you, Katara. [  She punches Katara's shoulder, her way of showing affection.  ]",35
Katara,Ow!,35
Shop owner,"If this is for a romantic picnic, may I suggest this lavender one? [  He points to another basket.  ]",35
Iroh,"No, it's not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion. [  He hands a coin to the owner, and takes the basket. As he goes, he sees a vase that contains a moon flower. He slides the vase into the shade, which causes the flowers to bloom instantly.  ] The moon flower likes partial shade. [  He bows to the shop owner and walks away.  ]",35
Boy's mother,Shhh. It's okay. Shhh.,35
Iroh,"[  He takes an instrument from the shop, and starts singing, walking toward the boy. Iroh gets down on one knee near the boy as he begins to sing.  ] Leaves from the vine, falling so slow.

Huge round angry face,Hey!,35
Iroh,"It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and seek to restore honor.",35
Huge round angry face,"[  Angrily.  ] When I'm through with you kids, the window won't be the only thing that's broken.",35
Iroh,But not this time. Run!,35
Tycho,"You, give me all your money!",35
Iroh,[  Confused.  ] What are you doing?,35
Tycho,I'm mugging you!,35
Iroh,[  Confused.  ] With that stance?,35
Tycho,"[  Looks at his stance in a confused manner.  ] Huh? What're you talking about? Just give me your money, old man!",35
Iroh,"[  He shakes his head.  ] With a poor stance, you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over. [  He quickly grabs the arm of the mugger and disarms him, while pushing his attacker and knocking him to the ground. He smiles, while twirling the dagger in his hand, and helps Tycho to his feet.  ]",35
Iroh,"[  Hands the knife back to Tycho.  ] With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat. [  Iroh demonstrates a proper stance, which Tycho attempts to imitate, but is still not assuming the correct form. Iroh walks over to him and holds his head still while he adjusts the man's stance with a light kick.  ] Much better! But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type.",35
Tycho,I know. I'm ... [  He sighs.  ] I'm just confused.,35
Tycho,So you really think I could be a good masseur?,35
Iroh,Of course!,35
Tycho,This is so great. No one has ever believed in me.,35
Iroh,"[  Smiling.  ] While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.",35
Iroh,"Happy birthday, my son. [  Cut to his face, as he starts to cry.  ] If only I could have helped you. [  He sings, but his voice cracks due to him crying.  ] Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.",35
Aang,"[  Kneeling on one knee and holding his hand out.  ] Hey there, fellow. You look hungry.",35
Kenji,They  are  hungry. [  Shot cuts to Kenji and Aang walking around in the zoo.  ] The Dai Li won't give me any money because the kids stopped coming. And the kids won't come because my zoo's nasty and broke.,35
Aang,[  Looking at a cage.  ] What kinda animal is that? [  They both stop walking.  ],35
Kenji,"Oh, that's a rabaroo. I wish I could get her a big open prairie like she likes. [  Shot cuts to the depressed rabaroo.  ] I'd let her hop away to happiness.",35
Aang,[  Smiling.  ] Let's do it!,35
Kenji,[  Surprised.  ] Say again?,35
Aang,There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city.,35
Kenji,But how're you gonna transport all these wild critters?,35
Aang,"Don't worry, I'm great with animals.",35
Cabbage merchant,"My cabba- [  He is interrupted by a rabaroo looking at him with a cabbage in her mouth. She chews it, and returns to the cart to eat more. The merchant throws down the cabbages he holds in his hand, and goes back.  ] Oh, forget it.",35
Aang,[  He scratches his head.  ] This was so much easier in my head.,35
Kenji,But you  have  to open this gate.,35
Guard,Or what?,35
Kenji,[  He points to a large stampede of creatures following Aang.  ] Or  that  !,35
Guard #2,[  Yelling.  ] Open the gate!,35

Zuko,It was nice.,35
"Scene changes to a very tall tree, so tall that it towers above the clouds. Appa flies up through the clouds and over to the tree. Shot cuts to show many fruits hanging from vines on the tree. Appa hovers underneath these and Momo, who was sitting on the sky bison's head, flies up and begins eating some fruit and tosses some down to Appa who eats them. As Momo continues to chew on one of the fruits, Appa suddenly roars very loudly.  The screen flashes white and shot cuts to Momo asleep on the windowsill of Team Avatar's house. Startled by the thunder that woke him from his dream, Momo leaps up into Sokka's Earth Kingdom bag that is hanging nearby. After some seconds, he pokes his head up and realizes he has some white fur lying on his head. Momo sniffs the fur, and shot cuts to a shot of Appa and Momo flying to indicate this is what Momo is thinking of. Appa roars again, and shot cuts back to Momo, as he chatters and realizes to whom the fur belongs.  Cut to a shot of the house form the lawn, with Momo visible through the window. A shadow that is very similar to Appa's crosses the ground. Cut back to Momo as he wraps the bunch of fur around one of his front legs, and soars out the window of the house and into the yard to investigate if this shadow belongs to the sky bison. As he emerges from a tree he flew up into, he realizes that the shadow is a cloud's. Disappointed, he holds his arm up and looks at the fur tied to it, but chatters a bit as he notices something. Shot cuts to show that on the other side of a house's roof, is what appears to be the head and horns of Appa. When Momo flies closer, however, he finds out it was only a tree with white leaves and branches sticking out in a way similar to Appa's horns. Momo lands on one of these branches and his ears drop in disappointment.  Scene changes to a street as Momo soars above it. He lands on a water barrel, and begins to drink from it. As he does, his wagging tail accidentally knocks over a stick sitting nearby. It falls to the ground with a noise that alerts three pygmy pumas who were rummaging in the garbage nearby. The pygmy pumas growl at Momo and suddenly pounce on him. Momo manages to dodge and runs into a box with an opening big enough for him but not enough for the panthers. The three pumas surround the box and growl, with two of them trying and catch the lemur through the openings. Momo manages to escape from an opening in the back of the box and flies away. The pygmy pumas chase him by running on rooftops, as one of them manages to push him to the ground. After hitting the ground, Momo gets to his feet and runs on foot into a group of people, and the pumas do not follow their prey into the crowd.  Momo is picked up by a man in the crowd and has a green little hat stringed to his head. He is tossed inside the circle of the people where two monkeys are already dancing to the beat of an organ grinder. After standing for a moment, Momo dances along. The crowd all cheer and clap for the dance, and the pumas stalk the lemur outside the circle of people, looking in between the legs at their prey. One of the monkeys jumps onto Momo's head and balances with its hand, the other doing the same on the first monkey's head, as Momo struggles to keep balance.  Just as Momo is about to lose his balance, the pumas roar and attack him. Momo flees again, but this time as he tries to fly away, one of the pumas grabs him, which slows him down. The other two panthers jump on and grab onto Momo, and all four creatures crash into the ground. When the dust clears, Momo is pinned to the ground by one of his the predators while the other two stand ready to strike their catch. However, before they can, a net flies in, captures all four of them, and drags them off.  Scene changes to the animal control officer placing Momo into a cage and locking it by placing a peg in to prevent the doors from opening. As the cart begins to move, Momo rubs the clump of Appa fur still tied to his arm against his face. Scene changes to an overhead shot of a small one-storied building, before cutting to inside the building, to show chicken meat. The cart has been pulled up inside the building. The butcher hits a log of wood with his knife. Shot cuts to shows the animal catcher and the butcher arguing, but their dialogue is only gibberish, as it is from Momo's perspective. Shot cuts to the three pygmy pumas, who are lying in the cage next to Momo, scratching at their cage and growling. Momo reaches through the bars and removes the peg that holds his cage shut. As he pushes the cage open and begins to run away, he stops and looks back. The pygmy pumas stare at him sadly from their cage. Sympathetically, Momo leaps back onto the cart and begins to remove the peg to free them. Cut to the two men approaching, but when the men reach the cart, they find both cages deserted as right behind them, as Momo and the panthers make their escape on the rooftops.  Fade into a scene on the roofs of the city, as Momo and his three new friends sit and watch the clouds. One of the panthers is affectionately rubbing against Momo. Suddenly, one of the panthers uses its mouth to remove the bunch of Appa's fur from Momo's arm. The panther with the fur runs off, with the other two pumas following, and Momo, chattering loudly, follows them as well. The panthers lead Momo through the streets of Ba Sing Se till finally one of them places the bunch of fur on a footprint shaped on the ground. Momo lands on the hole as the pumas run off. Momo looks at this strange hole and realizes that it is actually a footprint made by Appa. Chattering, Momo lies down on the ground holding the bunch of fur. The camera zooms back to show the panthers sitting nearby, watching as the rain begins to fall on Momo, lying on the large footprint. Fade to credits.",,35
Toph,No! Stop sinking!,36
Toph,"Don't make me put this down! [  Lets go of the library and sends a slice of sand at the sandbenders, which misses completely. She grabs the library again.  ]",36
Ghashiun,Put a muzzle on him!,36
Toph,"[  Regretfully.  ] I'm sorry, Appa. [  She sniffles and closes her eyes.  ]",36
Ghashiun,Ransack his saddle. Who knows what treasures are stashed in there!,36
Ghashiun,He's tied up good. He can't hurt you.,36
Sandbender #1,[  To Ghashiun.  ] What's your father gonna do when he finds out we lost a sand-sailer?,36
Ghashiun,Nothing. It's the one we stole from the Hami Tribe. [  To the two sandbenders on Appa's saddle.  ] Did you empty the saddle? [  Walks up to Sokka's club among a sleeping pad and parasol.  ] That's it? Nothing but garbage!,36
Sandbender #2,[  Jumps off Appa with the other sandbender and kicks a box.  ] Doesn't matter. We'll still make a profit from selling him to those beetle-headed merchants.,36
Merchant #1,[  Walks to the side of Appa's head.  ] How's his temper?,36
Ghashiun,"Uh, pretty good. [  Appa roars, startling two of the merchants. Ghashiun chuckles.  ] Most of the time.",36
Merchant #2,I bet someone will pay a fortune for him in Ba Sing Se.,36
Merchant #1,"All right, you've got a deal.",36
Aang,"Appa! Appa! [  Closer shot of Aang, who blows his bison whistle.  ]",36
Ghashiun,[  Sailing away with his sandbenders.  ] He's your problem now! [  Laughs.  ],36
Merchant #2,What?,36
Merchant #1,We need the shirshu spit darts!,36
Merchant #2,"[  Pulls a dart out of his robe.  ] Got 'em! Okay big fella, you're gonna take a nice little snoozle. [  Blows three darts at Appa's feet.  ]",36
Aang,"Appa! [  The camera pans up to the empty desert. Aang's eyes start watering and he closes them.  ] No. [  Opens his eyes with anger.  ] No! [  Slams his glider against the ground, using airbending to send sand up into the air.  ]",36
Merchant #1,We've gotta get rid of this one. He's too much trouble.,36
Merchant #2,[  Appa's vision starts blacking out.  ] We could sell it for parts.,36
Trainer,"[  Sighs.  ] I understand [  The camera fades from black to show a circus trainer standing outside a cage.  ] you've had a rather hard time lately. That's too bad. You probably felt you had no choice but to behave outrageously, like a wild animal. [  Cut to outside the cage, where the trainer pats Appa on the head.  ] But don't worry. You won't anymore. [  Frontal shot. Darkly.  ] Because I am going to break you.",36
Trainer,"Hungry? [  Walks up to Appa.  ] Don't worry, I'm going to feed you too. [  Shows a cabbage to the drooling Appa.  ] But not yet. [  Takes away the cabbage as Appa tries to slurp it up. Walks up to the lion vulture.  ] First, I'm going to show you how you'll earn it. [  Gives the cabbage to the lion vulture and opens the cage.  ]",36
Trainer,"Of course, when you perform, the hoops will be flaming. And if you are careful, you won't get burned. [  Appa belches loudly and the circus trainer quickly turns around.  ] You're about to be sorry. [  Firebends a whip and creates a fire in front of Appa's cage, causing Appa to panic.  ] It's obvious that whoever your previous owner was, he had no idea how to handle you properly.",36
Fire Nation man,[  To the boy.  ] I'm gonna to go get a bag of sizzle crisps. [  Pointing at the ground.  ] Stay here and [  Pointing at Appa.  ] stay away from that monster. Behave yourself or [  The boy flinches slightly.  ] you'll regret it.,36
Trainer,"[  Walking in front of Appa with the circus master, Shuzumu.  ] He's a difficult creature, stubborn and willful. I need more time with him. It's too risky right now.",36
Shuzumu,"[  Closer shot of him and the trainer.  ] Too risky? What are you talking about? [  Raises his hands up.  ] This is the circus, home of fear and danger. [  Points at Appa.  ] I want the wind buffalo to perform tonight.",36
Trainer,"[  Turns to Appa.  ] If you don't behave yourself, you'll regret it. [  Firebends a flame in front of Appa, causing the bison to reel back in fear, and walks away.  ]",36
Fire Nation man,[  Grabs the boy's shoulder.  ] Let's go.,36
Unnamed Fire Nation boy,"[  Waves at Appa.  ] See you later, buddy.",36
Shuzumu,"[  Voice-over.  ] Ladies and gentlemen, now for something truly special. [  Frontal shot. Creates two flames with his hands.  ] A noble beast, so magnificent and rare, it hasn't been seen by human eyes in generations. I give you ... the wind buffalo!",36
Trainer,"Up. [  Appa shakes his head and turns around in a circle. The audience laughs.  ] Up, you insolent cow! [  Summons a firebending whip and snaps it at Appa.  ]",36
Unnamed Fire Nation boy,[  Stands up.  ] Run away! Get away from him! [  His father makes him sit back down.  ],36
Fire Nation man,Fabulous!,36
Unnamed Fire Nation boy,"Go, you can do it.",36
Trainer,"Get back here, you stupid beast! [  Creates a fire whip.  ]",36
Iio,Choose well. A sky bison is a companion for life.,36
Aang,I guess this means we'll always be together. [  Laughs as Appa continues licking his face.  ],36
Aang,Always.,36
Farmer,[  Wielding a pitchfork.  ] Ahhh! It's some kind of monster!,36
Zuko,[  Sitting up on the deck floor.  ] Uncle? What are you looking at? Is there something out there?,36
Iroh,"[  Nervously.  ] Uh, it's nothing. Go back to sleep. [  Zuko lies back down and Iroh sighs.  ]",36
Kyoshi Warrior #1,Must have been some fight.,36
Suki,"Wait, let me see that. [  The Kyoshi Warrior hands the clump of fur to her.  ] No, it couldn't be. [  The camera pans up to show Appa's trail of fur on the cliff. Suki follows the trail and gasps when she reaches the top.  ] Appa? Oh, no. [  Close-up of Appa, who backs away into the passage in fear as Suki walks up. She stops and kneels down, putting several berries and an apple on the ground.  ] It's gonna be okay, Appa. [  Stands up and back away.  ] I have to leave, but I'm gonna be back soon with help.",36
Suki,No sudden movements. He's been lost for a while and he looks like he's hurt. [  Closer shot of the Kyoshi Warriors.  ] He's shy around people and scared. Stay low and stay quiet.,36
Kyoshi Warrior #1,I can't believe you found the Avatar's bison. Didn't you just see the Avatar a few days ago?,36
Suki,"Yes, so he can't be too far from here. [  Walking up the hill.  ] It's our responsibility to get Appa back to him safely. This could be our most important mission yet. [  The Kyoshi Warriors peer over the top of the hill at Appa, who growls and shakes his head at the intruders.  ] Give him some space! [  The other Kyoshi Warriors take a step back. Suki takes a step forward.  ] Appa, it's me, Suki. I'm a friend. [  Appa growls and Suki slowly approaches Appa.  ] I want to help you. You're hurt. We can help you feel better. [  Appa growls in response.  ] And we can help you find Aang. [  Appa softly growls and Suki places her hands Appa's nose and Appa lies down with Suki kneeling in front.  ]",36
Azula,"[  Holding a clump of Appa's fur.  ] My, my, you're easy to find. It's really astounding my brother hasn't captured you yet.",36
Suki,What do you want with us?,36
Azula,Who are you? The Avatar's  fan girls  ?,36
Ty Lee,"[  Beat.  ] Oh, I get it. Good one, Azula.",36
Suki,"If you're looking for the Avatar, you're out of luck.",36
Mai,[  Aerial view; Mai sighs.  ] I knew this was a waste of time.,36
Azula,"No Avatar, huh. Well, that's okay. Any friend of the Avatar [  Jumps off the mongoose lizard.  ] is an enemy of mine! [  Firebends at Appa, who the Kyoshi Warriors protect by moving their shields together.  ]",36
Kyoshi Warrior #2,Huh? [  Looks at the weapons on her right arm in confusion.  ],36
Mai,"You're so colorful, it's making me nauseous. [  Throws a bunch of darts at the second Kyoshi Warrior.  ]",36
Ty Lee,You're not prettier than we are.,36
Azula,"Afraid of fire, I see. That's good. You should be.",36
Suki,"[  Unsheathes her sword.  ] Go, Appa! Fly away from here!",36
Suki,Get out of here! You have to find Aang! We'll be okay!,36
Azula,[  Calmly.  ] Don't you know fans just make flames stronger?,36
Pathik,[  Blinks in confusion.  ] Hello. I am Guru Pathik. [  Aerial shot as Appa flies to the back of the balcony and closer shot as he growls at the guru.  ] I know I'm not the person you expected. And I didn't expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now. [  Side shot of Appa and Pathik on the balcony.  ] The world is full of surprises.,36
Pathik,"Oh, dear. You've been through so much recently. Hurt and betrayed. So twisted up inside. [  Moves his hand.  ] You're still full of love. Ah. But fear has moved in where trust should be. [  The camera shows a further shot of the balcony and pans up to the Air Temple; voice-over.  ] I've been expecting you and the young Avatar for quite a long time. I had a vision many years ago of helping him. That's why I came to the Eastern Air Temple. [  Closer shot of Appa and Pathik.  ] Oh, your emotions are so turbulent. Like swirling storm clouds. [  Puts his hand on Appa's forehead.  ] Let the clouds in your mind be gentle, peaceful ones. [  Appa purrs and the shot fades to black.  ]",36
Pathik,"Someone looks very well rested, [  Cut to Appa, whose fur on one side of his head is slightly messed up.  ] judging by your bed head. [  Appa growls and shakes away the bed head.  ]",36
Pathik,"I have prepared a message for Aang. May I attach it to your horn? [  Appa mutter in agreement and Pathik ties the scroll to Appa's horn. Cut to the leaves falling overhead and pan down to Appa and Pathik.  ] You and the Avatar's energies are mixed. You have an unbreakable bond. By reading your energy, I can sense where Aang is. [  Appa licks him.  ] Funny, what invisible strings connect us all. [  Places his hand on Appa's forehead. Further shot of the Air Temple as a path of light illuminates a pathway.  ] I'll see you again, great beast. [  Closer shot of Pathik and Appa.  ]",36
Katara,[  Cheerfully.  ] We found a printer to make our posters! [  Reveals the poster and Aang smiles and points at it.  ],37
Sokka,"Hey, I thought designing the lost Appa poster was my job. I've been working all day on my Appa! [  Shows his crudely drawn picture of Appa with a proud smile. Cut to an exasperated Aang while Katara tries to hold back her laughter.  ]",37
Aang,"Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head.",37
Sokka,[  Dismayed.  ] This is his head. [  Points to the sketch.  ],37
Katara,"[  Takes the picture from Sokka, looks confused.  ] Why are feet coming out of it?",37
Sokka,"[  Snatches back the picture indignantly.  ] Those are his horns. [  Hangs his head.  ] I haven't seen him in a while, okay?",37
Toph,[  Mockingly.  ] It looks just like him to me!,37
Sokka,"Thank you, I worked really- [  Suddenly remembering that she is blind.  ] Why do you feel the need to do that?",37
Katara,Let's just stick with the professional version.,37
Aang,"[  Excitedly.  ] Come on, let's get busy! [  Holds up some pamphlets.  ]",37
Quon,"So, you're the genius behind this incredible brew. The whole city is buzzing about you! I hope Pao pays you well.",37
Iroh,Good tea is its own reward.,37
Quon,But it doesn't have to be the  only  reward. How would you like to have your own tea shop?,37
Iroh,"[  Frontal view. Pao looks around, concerned.  ] My own tea shop? This is a dream come true!",37
Pao,[  Quickly moving to stand between the group.  ] What's going on here? Are you trying to poach my tea-maker?,37
Quon,"Sorry Pao, but that's business for you, am I right?",37
Pao,"Mushi, if you stay, I'll make you assistant manager. Wait, senior assistant manager!",37
Quon,"I'll provide you with a new apartment in the Upper Ring. [  Cut to Zuko, who was busy putting empty tea cups on a tray, but now looks up and glances over his shoulder to follow Quon's offer more closely; voice-over.  ] The tea shop is yours to do whatever you want, [  Cut back to frontal shot of Quon.  ] complete creative freedom.",37
Iroh,I even get to name the shop?,37
Quon,Of course!,37
Pao,"Uh, senior executive assistant manager?",37
Iroh,"Did you hear, nephew? This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the Upper Ring of the city!",37
Quon,"That's right, young man, your life is about to change for the better!",37
Zuko,"[  Sarcastically.  ] I'll try to contain my joy. [  Walks outside, slams door shut.  ]",37
Aang,I just finished dropping all the leaflets. Has anyone come in with news about Appa?,37
Katara,"It's only been a day. Just be patient. [  Aang sits, unenthused.  ]",37
Aang,"Wow, you're right! Patience really pays off! [  Opens the door, revealing the ""original"" Joo Dee has returned.  ] Joo Dee?",37
Joo Dee,"Hello, Aang, and Katara, and Sokka, and Toph.",37
Sokka,[  They approach as Joo Dee enters.  ] What happened to you? Did the Dai Li throw you in jail?,37
Joo Dee,What? Jail? Of course not. The Dai Li are the protectors of our cultural heritage.,37
Toph,But you disappeared at the Earth King's party.,37
Joo Dee,"Oh, I simply took a short vacation to Lake Laogai, out in the country. It was quite relaxing. [  Sokka glares at her skeptically.  ]",37
Katara,But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was Joo Dee.,37
Joo Dee,[  Surprised.  ] I'm Joo Dee.,37
Aang,Why are you here?,37
Joo Dee,Dropping fliers and putting up posters isn't permitted within the city. Not without proper clearance.,37
Sokka,We can't wait around to get permission for everything.,37
Joo Dee,You are absolutely forbidden by the rules of the city to continue putting up posters.,37
Aang,"[  Angrily screaming; during this brief argument, Aang is shown as a chibi and his head turns scarlet red.  ] We don't care about the rules and we're  not  asking permission! [  Camera cuts to Joo Dee's horrified face. She slowly backs out of the house as Aang continues to yell at her.  ] We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our way! [  Slams the door as she exits.  ]",37
Sokka,That might come back to bite us in the blubber.,37
Aang,"[  Calming down.  ] I don't care! From now on, we do whatever it takes to find Appa!",37
Toph,"Yeah, let's break some rules! [  Takes out a side of the house with earthbending.  ]",37
Long Feng,"I'm very disappointed in your work with the Avatar and his friends, Joo Dee. I had hoped that you would be able to control this situation.",37
Joo Dee,"I am so sorry, but they don't trust me anymore. [  Starts getting upset.  ] I don't think I can keep working like this! [  Begins to sob.  ]",37
Long Feng,"Joo Dee, the Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai.",37
Joo Dee,[  Camera zooms toward her eye as its iris dilates; in a monotone voice.  ] I am honored to accept his invitation.,37
Long Feng,"[  Nods.  ] Good. Now go await further orders. [  Joo Dee nods and begins to exit. Long Feng gets up and moves to the fireplace.  ] If the Avatar keeps searching for his bison, it could upset the delicate balance we've worked so hard to achieve in this city. It could even cost us control of the Earth King.",37
Dai Li agent,Should we take care of him?,37
Long Feng,No. It's much too dangerous for us to confront him directly. Let's see if we can still handle this quietly.,37
Iroh,"So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.",37
Zuko,[  Shows Iroh the flyer.  ] The Avatar is here in Ba Sing Se and he's lost his bison.,37
Iroh,"[  Grabs the flyer.  ] We have a chance for a new life here. [  Cut to Zuko looking out a window.  ] If you start stirring up trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us.",37
Zuko,[  Turns to Iroh.  ] Good things that are happening for  you  ! Have you ever thought that I want more from life than a nice apartment and a job serving tea?,37
Iroh,There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want from your life and why.,37
Zuko,I want my destiny.,37
Iroh,"What that means is up to you. [  Zuko walks away. Continues brainstorming names for his new tea shop.  ] The Tea Weevil! No, that's stupid.",37
Sokka,"We'll split up to cover more area. Toph, I guess you should just come with me.",37
Toph,"[  Peevishly.  ] Why? Because you think I can't put up posters on my own?! [  Angrily takes the paintbrush of glue from Sokka and throws glue on the wall. She slams a poster on it, but it is backward. Awkward pause.  ] It's upside-down, isn't it? I'll just go with Sokka.",37
Jet,Katara?,37
Jet,"[  Walks closer. Smiling confidently.  ] I think I can help you. [  Katara's shocked blush transforms into a look of pure outrage. With a sweep of her arms, she bends up water from a lake directly at him while screaming in rage. Jet looks at the wave in fright.  ] Katara, I've changed!",37
Katara,"[  Bending up remaining water from the wave.  ] Tell it to some other girl, Jet! [  Turns the water to ice, which sends Jet back to a wall.  ]",37
Jet,"[  Blocks the ice with his swords.  ] I don't want to fight you, I'm here to help!",37
Sokka,"Katara, what is it?",37
Katara,Jet's back. [  Close-up of Jet's face. Cut to aerial view before switching to a closer view of the group.  ] We can't trust anything Jet says.,37
Sokka,But we don't even know why he's here!,37
Katara,"I don't care why he's here, whatever the reason is, it can't be good!",37
Jet,I'm here to help you find Appa! [  Opens his hand and reveals he is holding a missing Appa poster.  ],37
Aang,"[  Turning from the leaflet back to Katara.  ] Katara, we have to give him a chance.",37
Jet,"I swear, I've changed! I was a troubled person and I let my anger get out of control, but I don't even have the gang now! I've put all that behind me!",37
Katara,You're lying!,37
Toph,[  Walks up to Jet and feels the wall he is pinned to.  ] He's not lying.,37
Sokka,How can you tell?,37
Toph,"I can feel his breathing and heartbeat. When people lie, there's a physical reaction. He's telling the truth.",37
Aang,"Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out.",37
Katara,All right. [  Points and looks angrily at Jet.  ] But we're not letting you out of our sight.,37
Jet,This is the place I heard about.,37
Aang,There's nothing here.,37
Katara,[  Preparing to waterbend in defense.  ] If this is a trap–,37
Jet,"I told you, I work nearby! Two guys were talking about some giant furry creature they had, I figured it must be Appa!",37
Toph,He was here! [  She shows them a clump of Appa's fur.  ],37
Aang,[  Sadly.  ] We missed him. [  An old white haired man with a push-broom crosses behind the slumping Aang.  ],37
Old Sweepy,"They took that big thing yesterday. [  Aang straightens with a shocked look.  ] Shipped him out to some island. About time, I've been cleaning up fur, and various, uhhh ... leavings all day.",37
Aang,[  Aang swiftly moves closer to the man.  ] What island? Where's Appa?,37
Old Sweepy,"Foreman said some rich royal type on Whaletail Island bought him up. Guess for a zoo or such. Though, could be the meat that'd be good.",37
Aang,We've got to get to Whaletail Island! [  Pauses.  ] Where's Whaletail Island? [  Dejectedly.  ],37
Sokka,"[  Looking at map.  ] Far, very far. [  Puts the map on the ground as they all gather round.  ] Here it is. It's near the South Pole, almost all the way back home.",37
Katara,"Aang, it will take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom. And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island.",37
Aang,I don't care. We have a chance to find Appa! We have to try!,37
Old Sweepy,Must be nice to visit an island. I haven't had a vacation for years.,37
Katara,Don't you have some more hair to clean up?,37
Old Sweepy,"Shuffle on, I get you. No more need for Old Sweepy ...",37
Katara,"You're right Aang, right now our first concern has to be finding Appa. We can come back when we have him.",37
Sokka,"All right, let's get moving.",37
Jet,I'll come with you.,37
Katara,We don't need your help!,37
Jet,Why won't you trust me? [  Walks after Sokka and Aang.  ],37
Katara,"Gee, I wonder.",37
Toph,[  After Jet walks away.  ] Was this guy your boyfriend or something?,37
Katara,What ... no! [  She folds her arms and looks away defiantly.  ],37
Toph,"[  Smiles.  ] I can tell you're lying ... [  Katara runs away from her, embarrassed.  ]",37
Sokka,We can take the train out to the wall but then we'll have to walk.,37
Aang,"Don't worry, on the way back we'll be flying!",37
Toph,We're finally leaving Ba Sing Se. [  Spreads her arms outward in celebration.  ] Worst ... city ... ever!,37
Smellerbee,[  Surprised.  ] Jet!,37
Katara,"[  Looks at Jet angrily.  ] I thought you said you didn't have your ""gang"" anymore!",37
Jet,"[  Turns to look at Smellerbee, confused.  ] I don't!",37
Smellerbee,[  Runs up to Jet and hugs him.  ] We were so worried. How did you get away from the Dai Li? [  Camera quickly zooms in to Katara's shocked face.  ],37
Katara,[  Shocked.  ] The Dai Li?!,37
Jet,I don't know what she's talking about!,37
Smellerbee,He got arrested by the Dai Li a couple of weeks ago. We saw them drag him away!,37
Jet,Why would I be arrested? I've been living peacefully in the city!,37
Toph,[  Feeling the ground between Jet and Smellerbee.  ] This doesn't make any sense. They're both telling the truth.,37
Katara,That's impossible.,37
Sokka,No it's not! Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed!,37
Jet,That's crazy! It can't be! [  Glances to the sides.  ] Stay away from me!,37
Zuko,"Out of my way, skinny!",37
Dai Li agent,Huh?,37
Zuko,"If you don't want to end up like him, you'll do what I say.",37
Katara,"The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot, too!",37
Aang,I bet they have Appa here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet! Where did they take you?,37
Jet,Nowhere! I- I don't know what you're talking about!,37
Aang,We need to find a way to jog his real memories.,37
Sokka,[  Teasingly.  ] Maybe Katara should kiss him. That should bring something back!,37
Katara,"Maybe  you  should kiss him, Sokka!",37
Sokka,"Hey, just an idea!",37
Aang,[  Jealously.  ] A bad one.,37
Sokka,"Ooh, wait! I've got it!",37
Jet,I don't think it's working. [  Spits it out.  ],37
Toph,Try to think of something from your past that triggers your emotions.,37
Smellerbee,The Fire Nation! Remember what they did to your family!,37
Katara,Close your eyes. Picture it.,37
Jet,[  Sweating.  ] No! It's too painful!,37
Katara,"Maybe this will help. [  Takes water and puts it around his ears, using healing to clear his mind.  ]",37
Jet,They took me to a headquarters under the water. Like a lake!,37
Sokka,Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said? She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai!,37
Jet,[  Stands up.  ] That's it! Lake Laogai.,37
Sokka,So where's this secret headquarters?,37
Jet,"Under the water, I think.",37
Toph,There's a tunnel right there by the shore.,37
Jet,It's all starting to come back to me!,37
Brainwasher,I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se.,37
Joo Dees,[  Simultaneously  .] I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se.,37
Brainwasher,We're so lucky to have our walls to create order.,37
Joo Dees,[  Simultaneously.  ] We're so lucky to have our walls to create order.,37
Jet,I think there might be a cell big enough to hold Appa up ahead. I think it's through here! [  Opens a door.  ],37
Zuko,Expecting someone else?,37
Sokka,Now that's something different.,37
Long Feng,You have made yourselves enemies of the state. Take them into custody.,37
Aang,[  Knocks away two agents with airbending.  ] Long Feng is escaping!,37
Long Feng,"All right, Avatar, you've caused me enough problems. This is your last chance ... if you want your bison back.",37
Aang,You do have Appa! Tell me where he is!,37
Long Feng,"Agree to exit the city now, and I'll waive all charges against you and allow you to leave with your lost pet.",37
Jet,[  Gets in a fighting position.  ] You're in no position to bargain.,37
Long Feng,Am I not?,37
Aang,[  Gets into a fighting position.  ] You're definitely not!,37
Long Feng,"Jet, the Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai.",37
Jet,"[  Close-up of his eye, his iris dilates. In a monotonous voice.  ] I am honored to accept his invitation.",37
Zuko,You're mine now.,37
Zuko,Uncle?,37
Iroh,"So, the Blue Spirit. I wonder who could be behind that mask ...",37
Zuko,[  Sighs and takes off the mask.  ] What are you doing here?,37
Iroh,I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep him locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?,37
Zuko,First I have to get it out of here.,37
Iroh,"[  Starts yelling.  ] And then what!? You never think these things through! [  Points at him.  ] This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had nowhere to go!",37
Zuko,I would have figured something out!,37
Iroh,"No! If his friends hadn't found you, you would have frozen to death!",37
Zuko,"I know my own destiny, Uncle!",37
Iroh,"Is it your own destiny, or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?",37
Zuko,"Stop it, Uncle! I have to do this!",37
Iroh,"I'm begging you, Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you, and what do  you  want?",37
Aang,"Jet, it's me, Aang! [  Runs back.  ] You don't have to do this!",37
Long Feng,I'm afraid he no longer has a choice.,37
Aang,"Jet, I'm your friend! Look inside your heart!",37
Long Feng,"Do your duty, Jet!",37
Aang,"He can't make you do this! [  Cut to a close-up of Jet's face as he hangs his head, while panting and sweating.  ] You're a Freedom Fighter!",37
Long Feng,Do it! Do it now!,37
Long Feng,[  Escaping upward to a pipe.  ] Foolish boy. You've chosen your own demise. [  Exits.  ],37
Jet,[  Weakly.  ] I'm sorry ... Aang.,37
Aang,[  Sadly.  ] Don't be.,37
Katara,This isn't good.,37
Smellerbee,You guys go and find Appa. We'll take care of Jet.,37
Katara,We're not going to leave you.,37
Longshot,There's no time. Just go. We'll take care of him. He's our leader.,37
Jet,"Don't worry, Katara. I'll be fine. [  Smiles a little.  ]",37
Toph,[  Whispering to Sokka.  ] He's lying ...,37
Aang,Appa's gone! Long Feng beat us here.,37
Sokka,"If we keep moving, maybe we can catch up with them!",37
Sokka,You think we can outrun them?,37
Aang,I don't think it's gonna matter!,37
Aang,"What is it, Momo?",37
Aang,Appa!,37
Long Feng,I can handle you by myself.,37
Sokka,Yeah! Appa!,37
Aang,"[  Happily crying.  ] I missed you, buddy.",37
Iroh,"You did the right thing, nephew. [  Zuko looks at his Blue Spirit mask as Iroh rests a hand on its shoulder.  ] Leave it behind.",37
Aang,"I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy. [  Momo flies into Appa to hug him too. Appa licks Aang, which causes Aang to laugh.  ]",38
Sokka,"Look, we escaped from the Dai Li. We got Appa back. I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.",38
Katara,One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.,38
Sokka,"We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we'll need the Earth King's support.",38
Toph,"What makes you think we'll get it? I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang.",38
Sokka,"I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different.",38
Katara,"Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.",38
Toph,I'm with Sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se. [  Raises arms and opens eyes wide.  ] And I can't even see!,38
Aang,"But now that we have Appa back, there's nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth. About the conspiracy and the War.",38
Sokka,See? Aang's with me. [  Puts his arm around Aang and smiles.  ] It's the whole reason we came here in the first place. We have to try.,38
Katara,"[  Thinks for a moment.  ] Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change. [  Sokka and Aang smile.  ]",38
Toph,"[  Stands up.  ] I don't trust the new positive Sokka. [  Points at Sokka in an accusing manner.  ] Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!?",38
Sokka,That's probably the Dai Li searching for us. [  To Katara.  ] So?,38
Katara,[  Determined.  ] Let's fly!,38
Toph,Can we please buy a new saddle? Riding bareback is terrifying! [  Buries face in Appa's back.  ],38
Sokka,There it is! That whole thing is the palace! The Earth King's chamber should be in the center!,38
Katara,We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming.,38
Sokka,"Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in and- [  A giant rock almost hits them.  ] Aahh!",38
Toph,What was that?,38
Sokka,Surface-to-air rocks! [  Sees more being launched.  ] More incoming!,38
Katara,[  Water whips two guards.  ] Sorry!,38
Katara,Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King!,38
Sokka,"Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side! [  Pauses for a moment.  ] Sorry.",38
Sokka,In there! [  They enter the palace.  ],38
Sokka,"Toph, which way to the Earth King?",38
Toph,How should I know? I'm still voting we  leave  Ba Sing Se.,38
Palace woman,"Burglar! [  Tries to run, trips, and falls flat on her face.  ]",38
Sokka,[  Shuts the door.  ] Sorry. Wrong door.,38
Iroh,You did the right thing. Letting the Avatar's bison go free.,38
Zuko,I don't feel right. [  Gets dizzy and passes out.  ],38
Iroh,Zuko! [  Rushes to him.  ],38
Sokka,"Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere. [  Drops down from the rubble and attempts to kick the door open.  ] Yaaah! [  The door does not move even slightly. Sokka starts trying to push it open, but to no avail. Toph and Aang jump in from behind and bust the door down, knocking Sokka forward in the process. He starts rubbing the back of his head.  ] A little warning next time?",38
Aang,We need to talk to you.,38
Long Feng,[  Turns to face the Earth King.  ] They're here to overthrow you.,38
Sokka,"No, we're on your side. We're here to help.",38
Katara,You have to trust us.,38
Kuei,"[  Stands up with a rising aggravated tone.  ] You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door, and you expect me to trust you?",38
Toph,He has a good point.,38
Kuei,"If you are on my side, then drop your weapons and stand down!",38
Aang,"[  Smiles.  ] See? We're friends, Your Earthiness. [  Gives a slight nervous chuckle.  ]",38
Long Feng,[  Smiles sinisterly.  ] Detain the assailants!,38
Sokka,But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.,38
Long Feng,Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again. [  The king looks at him shocked.  ],38
Kuei,The Avatar? [  Points at Sokka.  ] You're the Avatar?,38
Sokka,"Uh, no. Him. [  Nudges his head at Aang.  ]",38
Aang,[  Effortlessly breaks free of his earth cuffs and raises his arms.  ] Over here. [  Re-attaches the cuffs.  ],38
Long Feng,"What does it matter, Your Highness? They're enemies of the state.",38
Kuei,"Perhaps you're right. [  Sees Bosco sniff and lick Aang, who laughs, and smiles at Long Feng.  ] Though Bosco seems to like him. [  Looks back at the team.  ] I'll hear what he has to say. [  Long Feng glares at Aang.  ]",38
Aang,"[  Walks forward.  ] Well, sir, there's a war going on right now. For the past one hundred years in fact. The Dai Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.",38
Kuei,A secret war? That's crazy!,38
Long Feng,Completely!,38
Aang,"Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes; he brainwashed our friend!",38
Long Feng,"[  Quickly turns to face the king.  ] All lies. I've never even seen a sky bison, Your Majesty. Frankly, I thought they were extinct.",38
Kuei,[  Sits down.  ] Your claim is difficult to believe. Even from an Avatar.,38
Long Feng,"[  Whispers in his ear.  ] These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks. [  Kuei looks shocked at what Long Feng is telling him.  ] If you listen to them, you're playing right into your own destruction.",38
Kuei,[  Thinks for a moment.  ] I have to trust my advisor.,38
Sokka,Wait! [  Turns to face the king with a big smile.  ] I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison. Ask him to lift his robe.,38
Long Feng,What? I am  not  disrobing! [  The king looks thoughtful before looking at Sokka suspiciously.  ],38
Aang,Right there! Appa bit him!,38
Sokka,"Never met a sky bison, huh?",38
Long Feng,[  Lowers his robe.  ] That happens to be a large birth mark. [  Sarcastically.  ] Thanks for showing everyone.,38
Kuei,Well I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from.,38
Sokka,Of course there is!,38
Kuei,"Yup. That pretty much proves it. [  Team Avatar cheers.  ] But it doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory. [  Team Avatar becomes downcast.  ] Though, I suppose this matter's worth looking into. [  Team Avatar look at each other approvingly, while Long Feng glares at the king before walking away with his agents.  ]",38
Iroh,You're burning up. [  Dips a cloth in water.  ] You have an intense fever. [  Places the cloth on Zuko's forehead.  ] This will help cool you down.,38
Zuko,"So thirsty. [  Sits up, but Iroh makes him lie back down.  ]",38
Iroh,[  Grabs a bucket with a spoon in it; takes out the spoon.  ] Here's some clean water to drink. [  Sits him up slightly.  ] Stay under the blankets and sweat this out.,38
Kuei,[  Feeling strange from exposition.  ] So this is what a train is like? I didn't realize it would be this ... public.,38
Katara,So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before?,38
Kuei,"I've never been outside the palace. [  Katara and Sokka look at each other; the Earth King looks outside and sees Aang flying on Appa.  ] Now that's the way to travel. [  Looks at Katara and Sokka.  ] So, may I ask where we're going?",38
Sokka,"Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.",38
Toph,It's gone!,38
Sokka,Oh don't tell me- ! [  Gives a thumbs up and a fake smile.  ] That's okay. Still got my positive attitude.,38
Katara,The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence!,38
Kuei,[  Looks suspicious.  ] Hm ... [  Sarcastically.  ] That seems awfully convenient.,38
Sokka,"Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more. [  Smiles and nods.  ]",38
Kuei,"Long Feng was right. This was a waste of time. [  Turns to leave.  ] If you'll excuse me, I'm going back to the palace.",38
Katara,[  Smiles with realization.  ] The wall. They'll never be able to cover that up in time.,38
Aang,"Oh, yeah. [  Hops to in front of the king.  ] If you come with us to the Outer Wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real.",38
Kuei,No Earth King has ever been to the Outer Wall. [  Walks past Aang.  ] I don't have any more time for this nonsense. [  Aang looks depressed.  ],38
Sokka,"[  Runs up to them.  ] If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa. [  The Earth King stops as Appa lows in the background. A pleased smile grows on his face.  ]",38
Toph,First time flying?,38
Kuei,It's both thrilling and terrifying!,38
Toph,"Yeah. [  Smiles.  ] I hate it, too.",38
Kuei,I have to be honest with you: part of me really hopes that what you're telling me about this war isn't true.,38
Aang,I wish it wasn't.,38
Blue dragon,"[  In Azula's voice.  ] It's getting late. Are you planning to retire soon, my lord?",38
Zuko,I'm not tired.,38
Blue dragon,"[  Into Zuko's ear.  ] Relax, Fire Lord Zuko. Just let go. Give in to it. Shut your eyes for a while.",38
Red dragon,"[  In Iroh's voice.  ] No, Fire Lord Zuko! Do not listen to the blue dragon. You should get out of here right now. Go! Before it's too late! [  Both dragons are poised to either side of Zuko.  ]",38
Blue dragon,"Sleep now, Fire Lord Zuko.",38
Blue dragon,Sleep. [  Voice grows louder and more hostile as it continues talking.  ] Just like  mother  !,38
Ursa,Zuko! Help me! [  A distraught Zuko is seen in her eyes.  ],38
Aang,[  Points at the drill.  ] It's still there!,38
Kuei,[  Shocked.  ] What is that?,38
Sokka,It's a drill. A giant drill [  Cut to the drill.  ] made by the Fire Nation to break through your walls. [  Cut to a close-up of the king who looks horrified.  ],38
Kuei,I can't believe I never knew. [  He looks to his right as he hears something.  ],38
Long Feng,"[  Appears on an earth elevator with two Dai Li agents.  ] I can explain this, Your Majesty. [  Walks toward the king.  ] This is nothing more than ... a construction project. [  Gestures his hand to the drill.  ]",38
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Really? Then perhaps you could explain why there's a [  Points to the drill as Kuei follows to where she is pointing. Cut to the Fire Nation insignia clearly shown on the drill.  ] Fire Nation insignia on your ""construction project"".",38
Long Feng,[  The king looks at him suspiciously.  ] Well it's imported of course. You know you can't trust domestic machinery. [  Looks at them worried.  ] Surely you don't believe these children instead of your most loyal attendant?,38
Kuei,"[  Looks at Team Avatar, who stare back innocently, then at Long Feng, who is glaring back.  ] Dai Li! Arrest Long Feng! I want him to stand trial for crimes against the Earth Kingdom.",38
Long Feng,You can't arrest me! You all need me more than you know! [  He is taken away.  ],38
Sokka,"[  Happily.  ] Looks like Long Feng is long gone! Ha! Ah, yeah, I've been waiting to use that one. [  Aang smiles at him and Katara gives him an unimpressed look.  ]",38
Kuei,"I want to thank you, young heroes, for opening my eyes. All this time, what I thought was a great metropolis was merely a city of fools. And that makes me the king fool. [  Buries his face in one of his hands.  ] We're at war. With the Fire Nation.",38
Sokka,"That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness: because we think you can help us end the war.",38
Aang,[  Momo climbs up Kuei's arm.  ] We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable.,38
Sokka,"But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity: A solar eclipse is coming. The sun will be completely blocked out by the moon, and the firebenders will be helpless.",38
Kuei,"What are you suggesting, Sokka?",38
Sokka,That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. [  Cut to a close-up of the king. Cut back to Sokka.  ] The Day of Black Sun.,38
Kuei,I don't know. That would require moving troops out of Ba Sing Se. We'd be completely vulnerable.,38
Sokka,"You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance.",38
Kuei,[  Thinks for a moment as everyone waits anxiously.  ] Very well. You have my support.,38
General How,Your Majesty. [  Walks up to Team Avatar and bows to the king.  ] I apologize for the interruption.,38
Kuei,"[  To Team Avatar.  ] This is General How. He's the leader of the Council of Five, my highest ranking generals.",38
General How,We searched Long Feng's office. I think we found something that will interest everybody. [  Team Avatar look at each other.  ],38
General How,There are secret files on everyone in Ba Sing Se. Including you kids.,38
Aang,Secret files?,38
Kuei,"[  Takes out a scroll and reads the side.  ] ""Toph Beifong."" [  Hands the scroll to General How, who hands it to Toph, who hands it to Katara.  ]",38
Katara,[  Opens the scroll and reads it.  ] It's a letter from your mom. Your mom's here in the city. And she wants to see you. [  Toph's eyes widen with shock.  ],38
Toph,Long Feng intercepted our letters from home? [  Shakes her head.  ] That's just sad.,38
Kuei,[  Takes out another scroll and hands it to Aang.  ] Aang?,38
General How,This scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the Dai Li captured it.,38
Aang,[  Opens the scroll and reads it.  ] It's from the Eastern Air Temple.,38
Katara,Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?,38
Kuei,[  Looks in the box.  ] I'm afraid not.,38
Sokka,[  He and Katara become downcast.  ] Oh.,38
General How,But there is an intelligence report that might interest you. [  Hands a scroll to Katara.  ],38
Katara,"[  Opens the scroll and reads it.  ] ""A small fleet of Water Tribe ships.""",38
Sokka,[  Shocked. Appears on Katara's side.  ] What? That could be Dad!,38
Katara,"[  Reads the report with excitement.  ] ""Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay. [  Her and Sokka's eyes widen.  ] Led by Hakoda."" [  Katara and Sokka turn to each other in excitement.  ] It  is  Dad!",38
Iroh,"You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea. [  Feeds Zuko the tea.  ]",38
Zuko,What's happening?,38
Iroh,Your critical decision. What you did beneath that lake. It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body. [  Feeds Zuko more tea.  ],38
Zuko,What's that mean? [  Coughs continuously and lies down.  ],38
Iroh,"You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, [  Takes a cloth and wipes Zuko's head.  ] you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be.",38
Aang,I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a guru.,38
Sokka,What's a guru? Some kind of poisonous blow fish?,38
Aang,"No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.",38
Katara,And I can't believe we know where our dad is now.,38
Toph,I know what you mean. My mom's in the city. And from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.,38
Sokka,This is all such big news! Where do we even start?,38
Katara,"I hate to say it, but we have to split up.",38
Aang,[  Worriedly.  ] Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together! Now you want us to separate?,38
Katara,"You have to meet this guru, Aang. If we're going to invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.",38
Aang,"Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple, Appa and I can drop you off at Chameleon Bay to see your dad.",38
Sokka,Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. [  Stands up.  ] I guess that's me.,38
Katara,"No, Sokka. I know how badly you wanna help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay. I'll stay here with the king.",38
Sokka,[  Overjoyed with tears welling in his eyes. Stands up and dances happily.  ] You are the nicest ... sister ... ever! [  Throws his arms around Katara and kisses her on the cheek.  ],38
Katara,"Easy there, big brother ... [  Gives a slight chuckle.  ] Though you're right. I am.",38
Aang,Katara? I need to tell you something. [  Starts blushing.  ] I've been wanting to say it for a long time.,38
Katara,"What is it, Aang?",38
Aang,"[  Rubs the back of his head.  ] Katara, I- [  He is cut off by Sokka.  ]",38
Sokka,"[  Throws Aang in a headlock.  ] All right. Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip? [  Noogies Aang. Katara looks at him, annoyed.  ]",38
Kuei,"Aang and Sokka, [  They look at him.  ] I wish you a good journey. Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks. We look forward to your safe return. [  Aang, Katara, and Sokka bow.  ]",38
Soldier,Your Majesty. There are three female warriors to see you. They're from the island of Kyoshi.,38
Sokka,[  Shocked.  ] That's Suki! [  Falls off Appa.  ],38
Kuei,You know these warriors?,38
Sokka,[  Gets up.  ] Oh yeah. The Kyoshi Warriors are a skilled group of fighters. Trustworthy too. They're good friends of ours.,38
Kuei,Then we shall welcome them as honored guests.,38
Katara,"[  Aang turns to Appa.  ] Wait. Aang. [  She hugs him, which startles him, then kisses him on the cheek, causing him to blush.  ]",38
Toph,I'm really gonna miss you guys.,38
Katara,"[  Hugs Toph with Aang. Sokka looks away, crossing his arms.  ] Me too.",38
Aang,Yeah.,38
Sokka,"[  Everyone goes to hug him.  ] Aahh! Great. That's enough. [  Smiles.  ] Okay, we love each other. [  Pats Aang and Katara on the head.  ] Seriously.",38
Sokka,"You see, Aang? A little positive thinking works wonders. We got the king on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me.",38
Aang,"[  Dreamily.  ] Yeah. Girls are waiting for us. Thanks, positive attitude.",38
Sokka,Everything is gonna work out perfectly. From now on and forever. [  Aang turns around and smiles at him.  ],38
Agent,"[  Slides a tray of food underneath the door.  ] Dinner. [  Long Feng grabs some food.  ] The Council of Five and the military are loyal to the Earth King, [  Long Feng looks at him.  ] but the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir. [  Walks away as Long Feng eats his food while smiling sinisterly.  ]",38
Toph,"[  Enters.  ] Hello? Mom? Anyone home? [  Walks to the center of the room. She senses something, but is quickly captured in a metal box. In a scared voice.  ] Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with!?",38
Xin Fu,One loud-mouthed little brat who strayed too far from home.,38
Kuei,"In our hour of need, it is with the highest honor that I welcome our esteemed allies, the Kyoshi Warriors!",38
Azula,We are the Earth King's humble servants.,38
Zuko,What's that smell?,39
Iroh,It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.,39
Zuko,"[  Sniffs.  ] Actually, it smells delicious. I'd love a bowl, Uncle. [  Holds a bowl up.  ]",39
Iroh,"Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow.",39
Zuko,"[  Optimistically.  ] It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop. [  Moves to a table and sits.  ] Things are looking up, Uncle. [  Starts drinking the jook. Iroh's shocked expression changes to a smile.  ]",39
Aang,You haven't seen your dad in over two years. You must be so excited!,39
Sokka,"[  Almost throwing up.  ] I know I should be, but, I just feel sick to my stomach. [  Holds his stomach.  ]",39
Aang,Don't be nervous. He's going to be so happy to see you! [  He puts his hand on Sokka's shoulder who smiles.  ],39
Sokka,So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this guru?,39
Aang,Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. I'll do whatever it takes. [  Sokka gets off Appa.  ] See you in a week. Yip yip!,39
Water Tribe warrior,"Sokka, good to see you.",39
Hakoda,Sokka.,39
Sokka,"Hi, Dad.",39
Kuei,"Look Bosco! The Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us! Aren't you excited? [  Bosco yawns.  ] It's been a difficult week for me. My most trusted advisor, Long Feng, and his Dai Li agents tried to take control of Ba Sing Se from me.",39
Azula,It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.,39
Kuei,"[  Pets Bosco.  ] But there is good news. As we speak, the Council of Five is meeting to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation this summer, on the day of a solar eclipse.",39
Azula,Really? Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan. [  Glances off as Mai and Ty Lee look at each other.  ],39
General How,"General Fong's base will serve as the launching point for the attack. In exactly two months, the army and navy will invade the Fire Nation on the Day of Black Sun.",39
Katara,"Or we could send in Momo to do some damage! [  Chuckles. The Council of Five are unamused.  ] 'Cause, the ... sorry.",39
General How,"[  Uses earthbending to stand the pieces back up, scaring Momo.  ] All we need is the Earth King's seal in order to execute the plan. [  Sends the scroll across the table to Katara.  ]",39
Katara,"I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How.",39
Aang,"Uhhh ... hello? You're Guru Pathik, right? [  Aang approaches Pathik.  ] The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?",39
Pathik,Indeed. I was a spiritual brother of your people and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso. [  Aang looks slightly surprised to hear this.  ],39
Aang,"In your note, [  Aang sits.  ] you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State. How?",39
Pathik,"You must gain balance within yourself, before you can bring balance to the world. And the first step to gaining balance begins with this. [  Hands Aang a yellow beverage in a wooden cup.  ] Drink up!",39
Aang,[  Takes it and looks at it. Drinks it and quickly spits it out to his left in disgust.  ] Uggh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!,39
Pathik,That's because it is! [  Pathik empties another bowl and holds it over his head.  ] Yum yum!,39
Yu,I believe we need to go right!,39
Xin Fu,What are you talking about? The Beifong Estate's this way!,39
Yu,I'm quite certain you're mistaken.,39
Toph,[  Banging at the cell.  ] Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second? [  Cut to inside the cell.  ] I got to go to the bathroom!,39
Yu,"Oooh ... uhhh, okay, but make it quick! [  Getting up with a key in hand.  ]",39
Xin Fu,[  Stopping Yu.  ] What's wrong with you?,39
Yu,"Ooh, very sneaky Toph! Nice try, but you can't trick me! [  Sits down.  ]",39
Toph,Let me out of here so I can kick both your butts!,39
Xin Fu,"Quit your banging! [  Bangs the metal box.  ] You might think you're the greatest earthbender in the world, but even you can't bend metal!",39
Azula,"We have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity, girls.",39
Ty Lee,Mai finally gets to wear make-up that's not totally depressing? [  Azula walks past toward a window.  ],39
Mai,"[  With large, dark splotches of black makeup dripping down her eyes; Sarcastically.  ] Ha, ha.",39
Azula,"I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom. [  The two girls turn with shocked looks.  ] For one hundred years, the Fire Nation has hammered away at Ba Sing Se from the outside. [  Walks away from the girls and smirks while looking out of a window.  ] But now we're on the inside, and we can take it by ourselves.",39
Ty Lee,"[  Admiringly.  ] Gosh, you're so confident. I really admire that about you.",39
Azula,"From the inside, we're in perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King. The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li [  Turns back into the room.  ] controls Ba Sing Se.",39
Pathik,"In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras.",39
Aang,[  Rubs eyes.  ] What are chakras?,39
Pathik,"[  Disappointedly.  ] Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basics. [  As he explains he points to the water and the moss within.  ] The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras.",39
Aang,So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?,39
Pathik,"Exactly. If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek. And then what happens?",39
Aang,The creek can't flow?,39
Pathik,"Yes. But, if we open the ponds between the pools ... [  He removes moss blocking the exit for the water.  ]",39
Aang,The energy flows! [  The water that was blocked by the moss becomes clear. Aang and Pathik smile at each other.  ],39
Pathik,"There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck. Be warned, opening the chakras is an intense experience, and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open. Are you ready?",39
Aang,[  Momentarily looks down.  ] I'll do whatever it takes.,39
Pathik,"First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and is blocked by fear. What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you.",39
Pathik,"Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival, but you must surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek. [  Aang clears the image away.  ] You have opened your Earth Chakra! [  Aang wipes sweat off his forehead.  ]",39
Pathik,Next is the ...,39
Aang,Water Chakra?,39
Pathik,"Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a guru too! This chakra deals with pleasure and is blocked by guilt. Now, look at all the guilt with burdens you so. What do you blame yourself for?",39
Aang,[  Sees the image of him leaving home.  ] I ran away. [  Sees images of him in the Avatar State at General Fong's base.  ] I hurt all of those people.,39
Pathik,"Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself. [  Aang takes a deep, focused breath, opening his Water Chakra.  ]",39
Hakoda,This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. We've been using these tangle mines to stop the Fire Nation ships from getting through.,39
Bato,[  Filling the mine with skunk fish and seaweed before moving away.  ] Your father invented tangle mines himself.,39
Sokka,"Destructive? Buoyant? And ... [  Sniffs and immediately becomes disgusted.  ] Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling!",39
Hakoda,"Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed. When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship. I call it the ""stink and sink.""",39
Sokka,"[  Laughs.  ] Good one, Dad!",39
Bato,"[  Nearby, unamused.  ] You're definitely your father's son.",39
Warrior,"[  Approaching.  ] Hakoda, our scouts have spotted four Fire Nation ships!",39
Hakoda,"Bato, get these mines loaded up! The rest of you men, prepare for battle!",39
Sokka,"Uhhh ... what should I do, Dad?",39
Hakoda,"Aren't you listening? I said, ""The rest of you men, get ready for battle"".",39
Iroh,"Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop? Follow your passion, Zuko, and life will reward you.",39
Zuko,"Congratulations, Uncle.",39
Iroh,I am very thankful.,39
Zuko,You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.,39
Iroh,No. I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me. It means more than you know. [  The two embrace.  ],39
Zuko,Now let's make these people some tea! [  Walks away to the back.  ],39
Iroh,"[  Overjoyed.  ] Yes, let's make some tea!",39
Pathik,"Third is the Fire Chakra, located in the stomach.",39
Aang,[  Holding his stomach.  ] My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.,39
Pathik,"[  Chuckles.  ] Good one! Moving on. This chakra deals with willpower, and is blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of? [  Cuts to Aang's vision of his first attempt at firebending, which resulted in him accidentally burning Katara's hands.  ] What are your biggest disappointments in yourself?",39
Aang,I'm never going to firebend again. I can't.,39
Pathik,"You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar and therefore, you are a firebender. [  Aang breathes deeply.  ] Hmmm ... that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a ... burping bison.",39
Aang,"[  Loud belch.  ] Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles? [  Pathik shrugs, and hums as if to say ""I don't know"".  ]",39
Mai,[  Sighs.  ] I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone could fight in this.,39
Ty Lee,"Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes. [  Punches the air, imitating her chi-blocking.  ]",39
Mai,"How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King? If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm going to throw up.",39
Ty Lee,[  Walks on her hands.  ] Princess Azula promised we would go back to the Fire Nation as soon as we captured the Avatar. We just have to be patient.,39
Mai,[  Stands up.  ] Shush up! Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation?,39
Ty Lee,Sorry!,39
Azula,"Good work, girls. I'm sure the Dai Li will deliver the message.",39
Pathik,The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love and is blocked by grief. [  Aang smiles and looks at a Air Nomad statue nearby before looking sad.  ] Lay all your grief out in front of you.,39
Pathik,"You have indeed felt a great loss. [  The airbenders appear floating in the clouds.  ] But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us. [  Aang is lifted into the air and sees the Air Nomads floating in the smoke.  ] The Air Nomads' love for you has not left this world. It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love.",39
Pathik,Let the pain flow away. [  Aang wipes away his tears.  ] Very good.,39
Aang,"[  Choking up.  ] Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?",39
Pathik,"The fifth in the chain is the Sound Chakra, located in the throat. It deals with truth and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves.",39
Katara (flashback),Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?,39
Aang,Because I never wanted to be.,39
Pathik,"You cannot lie about your own nature. You must accept that you are the Avatar. [  Aang inhales and, seeing an image of himself on a cliff looking down at the ground, exhales, and accepts his nature.  ] Very good, Aang. You have opened the chakra of truth.",39
Pathik,"The sixth pool of energy is the light chakra, located in the center of the forehead. It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation. Things you think are separate and different are actually one in the same.",39
Aang,"[  An image is shown of the world, with the four nations' territories marked.  ] Like the four nations.",39
Pathik,"[  The image changes so the territories become the same color.  ] Yes. We are all one people, [  The territories become separate again.  ] but we live as if divided.",39
Aang,We're all connected. Everything is connected.,39
Pathik,"That's right! Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion. If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined.",39
Toph,"[  Struggling.  ] Come on, metal. Budge! [  She punches a hole in the metal and shakes her hand in pain.  ] Wooo! Toph, you rule.",39
Katara,"What do you say, Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king? [  Arrives at the shop.  ] Table for two, please.",39
Zuko,"Uncle! I need two jasmine, one green, and one lychee!",39
Iroh,I'm brewing as fast as I can!,39
Aang,"This is the last chakra, isn't it?",39
Pathik,"Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able to go in and out of the Avatar State at will and when you are in the Avatar State, you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions.",39
Aang,[  Smiles with determination.  ] Let's do this.,39
Pathik,"The Thought Chakra is located at the crown of the head. It deals with pure cosmic energy, and is blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world. [  Images of Katara appear before Aang.  ] Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river, forgotten.",39
Aang,[  Coming out of his meditation.  ] What? Why would I let go of Katara? I ... I love her!,39
Pathik,"Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe.",39
Aang,Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara? [  Aang throws his hands up.  ] How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago that was a good thing!,39
Pathik,You must learn to let go. [  Aang contemplates worriedly.  ],39
Katara,"Thank goodness you're here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city, I just saw Prince Zuko and his uncle! [  Azula widens her eyes in surprise and smiles slyly.  ] We have to tell the Earth King right away!",39
Azula,"Oh, don't worry, I'll be sure to let him know.",39
Azula,"[  While the three girls gather around the fallen Katara; pans to camera looking up to the three girls.  ] So, Zuzu's in the city, too? I think it's time for a family reunion. [  Momo flies off.  ]",39
Aang,"I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.",39
Pathik,"Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Surrender yourself.",39
Aang,"Okay, I'll try.",39
Pathik,Now think of your attachments and let them go. Let the pure cosmic energy flow.,39
Aang,Katara's in danger! I have to go! [  Prepares to exit.  ],39
Pathik,"No, Aang! By choosing attachment, you have locked the chakra! If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!",39
Yu,It's another one her tricks!,39
Xin Fu,There's a giant hole in the box! How is that a trick!?,39
Toph,[  From behind them.  ] It's not! It's the real deal!,39
Toph,[  Jumps on top of the box.  ] I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it! [  Stomps on the box and exits using earth surfing.  ],39
Xin Fu,"[  Inside the box.  ] I'm going to be stuck in here forever with you, aren't I?",39
Yu,I have to go the bathroom. [  Xin Fu groans and slams his head against the box.  ],39
Hakoda,Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?,39
Sokka,"You don't know how much this means to me, Dad. I'll make you proud and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am.",39
Hakoda,"[  Placing his hand on Sokka's shoulder.  ] Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me. I'm already proud of you and I've always known you're a great warrior.",39
Sokka,Really?,39
Hakoda,Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left?,39
Sokka,This can't be good news.,39
Azula,What is this about? Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here? You will not treat a Kyoshi Warrior this way!,39
Long Feng,"But you're not a Kyoshi Warrior, are you, [  Standing.  ] Princess Azula of the Fire Nation?",39
Azula,What do you want?,39
Long Feng,I want to make a deal. It's time that I regain control of Ba Sing Se and you have something I need.,39
Azula,Oh?,39
Long Feng,The Earth King's trust.,39
Azula,Why should I help you?,39
Long Feng,Because I can get you the Avatar.,39
Azula,[  Smirks.  ] I'm listening ...,39
Royal messenger,A message from the Royal Palace.,39
Iroh,"[  Reads through, becomes shocked, and smiles.  ] I ... I can't believe it!",39
Zuko,"What is it, Uncle?",39
Iroh,[  Excited.  ] Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King! [  Runs off.  ],39
Sokka,"So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?",40
Aang,"I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help.",40
Sokka,"It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time. [  He looks down and notices a mound of earth passing nearby, heading to the wall.  ] What is that?",40
Sokka,Need a ride?,40
Azula,"[  While pacing back and forth.  ] The Earth King and the Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death. [  As she talks, an agent with a mustache starts looking nervous and slightly lowers his head.  ] This coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government. [  Walks over to her left, to another agent with a tiny, vertical scar on his right cheek. When she nears him, she stares sideways at the agent while still addressing all the agents.  ] If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, [  She stops right in front of the scarred agent.  ] I will snuff it out. [  She continues walking, with the eyes of the now nervous scarred agent following her.  ] That is all.",40
Ty Lee,"Nice speech, Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way. [  She hands the cup to Azula. Camera pans over to a close-up of Mai.  ]",40
Mai,[  Amused.  ] Yeah. I thought you were going to make that one guy pee his pants.,40
Azula,"There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and uncle.",40
Iroh,"Many times I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace. [  Camera pans to show the Earth Kingdom Emblem above the palace doors.  ] But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror. Instead, we are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.",40
Zuko,"It sure is, Uncle.",40
Toph,So how did it go with the guru? Did you master the Avatar State?,40
Aang,Uh ...,40
Pathik,"If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!",40
Sokka,"Aang, are you okay?",40
Aang,I'm great! It went great with the guru. I completely mastered the Avatar State. [  He laughs nervously and looks down.  ] Yeah.,40
Zuko,What's taking so long?,40
Iroh,Maybe the Earth King overslept.,40
Zuko,Something's not right.,40
Azula,It's tea time!,40
Zuko,[  He quickly stands up.  ] Azula!,40
Azula,"Have you met the Dai Li? They're earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct that's  so  firebender. I just love it.",40
Iroh,"Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname ""The Dragon of the West""?",40
Azula,"I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, Uncle. [  She looks at her nails condescendingly.]",40
Iroh,"It's more of a demonstration, really.",40
Iroh,Come on! You'll be fine!,40
Zuko,No! I'm tired of running! It's time I faced Azula!,40
Azula,You're  so  dramatic. What? Are you going to challenge me to an Agni Kai?,40
Zuko,Yes! I challenge you!,40
Azula,No thanks.,40
Kuei,Katara's fine. You have nothing to worry about.,40
Aang,"But, in my vision, I felt so sure she was in trouble.",40
Kuei,"Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion, and since then, she been off with your friends, the Kyoshi Warriors.",40
Sokka,"See, Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now talking about make-up or something.",40
Aang,Okay. Maybe you're right.,40
Kuei,"Believe me, if there was any danger at all, Bosco's animal instincts would sense it.",40
Dai Li agent,You've got company.,40
Katara,Zuko!,40
Aang,Momo!,40
Toph,There's no one else here.,40
Aang,Katara  is  in trouble! I knew it!,40
Sokka,"Oh, no!",40
Toph,"Wait! Someone's at the door. [  Someone knocks on the door a second later.  ] Actually, I know who it is. It's an old friend of mine. [  She walks over to the door and opens it, showing Iroh behind the door.  ] Glad to see you're okay.",40
Iroh,I need your help.,40
Aang,You guys know each other?,40
Toph,I met him in the woods once and knocked him down. [  Iroh smiles sheepishly and rubs the back of his head.  ] Then he gave me some tea and some very good advice.,40
Iroh,"May I come in? [  Toph nods, and he walks in before turning to the group.  ] Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.",40
Aang,She must have Katara.,40
Iroh,She has captured my nephew as well.,40
Aang,"Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.",40
Sokka,"[  Approaching Aang and pointing at him.  ] Whoa there! You lost me at ""Zuko"".",40
Iroh,I know how you must feel about my nephew. [  Moving forward to place his hands on Sokka's shoulders.  ] But believe me when I tell you that there is  good  inside him.,40
Sokka,"[  Pushing Iroh away.  ] ""Good inside him"" isn't enough! Why don't you come back when it's  outside  him too, okay?",40
Aang,Katara's in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance.,40
Iroh,I brought someone along who might help us.,40
Captured agent,Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup! They're going to overthrow the Earth King!,40
Sokka,My sister! Where are they keeping Katara?,40
Captured agent,"In the Crystal Catacombs of Old Ba Sing Se, deep beneath the palace.",40
Head of the Dai Li,The movements of the Earth King and all the generals have been plotted out step-by-step.,40
Long Feng,Good. And the Fire Nation princess is cooperating?,40
Head of the Dai Li,"Oh, yes. More than cooperating. She's really taken charge. She's terrifying and inspirational at the same time. It's hard to explain.",40
Katara,"Why did they throw you in here? [  Zuko says nothing.  ] Oh, wait, let me guess. It's a trap. So that when Aang shows up to help me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches!",40
Katara,[  Continuing to lament.  ] You're a terrible person! You know that? Always following us! Hunting the Avatar! Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood!,40
Zuko,[  Looks back at her.  ] You don't know what you're talking about!,40
Katara,"[  Enraged.  ] I don't? How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through! [  Sits down.  ] Me personally! [  She sits down and touches her necklace, begins to cry.  ] The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.",40
Zuko,[  He turns around to face Katara.  ] I'm sorry. [  Pauses. Katara is now sobbing.  ] That's something we have in common.,40
Toph,"Well, what'd you know? There  is  an ancient city down there. But it's deep.",40
Sokka,"We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk, [  Remembers Iroh is there and places his left hand on Iroh's right shoulder.  ] no offense.",40
Iroh,[  Shrugging.  ] None taken.,40
Sokka,And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King of Azula's coup.,40
Aang,"So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea!",40
Iroh,The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?,40
Aang,"Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this  great  power, but to do it, I had to let go of someone I love. [  He and Iroh stop.  ] And I just couldn't.",40
Iroh,Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.,40
Aang,"[  Earthbends again.  ] What happens if we can't save anyone and beat Azula? Without the Avatar State, what if I'm not powerful enough?",40
Iroh,"I don't know the answer. Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving, [  Aang earthbends the rocks away one last time. Iroh's fire blows out. He smiles.  ] you will come to a better place.",40
Sokka,There's General How!,40
How,What's going on here?!,40
Dai Li agent,You're under house arrest.,40
Sokka,The coup is happening right now! We've gotta warn the Earth King!,40
Sokka,Thank goodness we're in time!,40
Kuei,In time for what?,40
Ty Lee,"Yeah. What are you in time for, [  Cartwheels to Sokka, standing just inches from his face.  ] cutie?",40
Sokka,"[  He begins to sweat and places his hand behind his head in discomfort. Nervously.  ] Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.",40
Ty Lee,Who?,40
Toph,They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!,40
Mai,[  Sarcastically.  ] Sorry to disappoint you.,40
Ty Lee,"Oooh, it's like we're dancing together!",40
Azula,[  Gravely.  ] This fight is over.,40
Azula,Get them all out of my sight.,40
Long Feng,"Now comes the part where I double cross you. Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation princess! [  None of the Dai Li agents move, to Long Feng's disappointment.  ] I said arrest her! [  Short pause. They still do nothing.  ] What is wrong with you?!",40
Azula,It's because they haven't made up their minds. [  Long Feng snaps his head toward Azula.  ] They're waiting to see how this is going to end.,40
Long Feng,What are you talking about?,40
Azula,"I can see your whole history in your eyes. You were born with nothing, so you've had to struggle, and connive, and claw your way to power. But true power, the divine right to rule, is something you're born with. The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne, and which one is going to be bowing down. [  Long Feng looks worried.  ] But I know, and you know. [  She sits down on the throne and crosses her legs.  ] Well?",40
Long Feng,"[  His worried look turns into fright, then into a look of submission. He walks up and bows to her  .] You've beaten me at my own game.",40
Azula,Don't flatter yourself! You were never even a player.,40
Katara,[  Apologetic.  ] I'm sorry I yelled at you before.,40
Zuko,It doesn't matter.,40
Katara,"It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.",40
Zuko,My face? I see. [  He touches his scar.  ],40
Katara,"No, no, that's-that's not what I mean. [  Approaches Zuko.  ]",40
Zuko,"It's okay. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.",40
Katara,Maybe you could be free of it.,40
Zuko,What?,40
Katara,I have healing abilities.,40
Zuko,"It's a scar, it can't be healed.",40
Katara,"[  Holds up a vial.  ] This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important. [  Moves in front of Zuko.  ] I don't know if it would work, but ...",40
Katara,Aang!,40
Katara,"Aang, I knew you would come. [  She hugs Aang again.  ]",40
Zuko,"Uncle, I don't understand. What are you doing with the Avatar? [  Points to Aang.  ]",40
Aang,"Saving you, that's what.",40
Iroh,"Zuko, it's time we talked. [  To Aang and Katara.  ] Go help you other friends. We'll catch up with you. [  They walk away, Katara looks back at Zuko, who is looking sadly to the side, before moving on.  ]",40
Zuko,"[  Hurt.  ] Why, Uncle?",40
Iroh,"You're not the man you used to be, Zuko. [  Smiles.  ] You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. [  Close-up to Zuko's face.  ] It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good.",40
Azula,"I expected this kind of treachery from Uncle. [  Cut to Iroh, still trapped in crystals. Cut to a side shot, where Zuko protects his uncle.  ] But Zuko,  Prince  Zuko, you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?",40
Zuko,Release him immediately.,40
Azula,"It's not too late for you, Zuko. You can still redeem yourself.",40
Iroh,[  To Zuko.  ] The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.,40
Azula,"Why don't you let  him  decide, Uncle? [  To Zuko.  ] I need you, Zuko. I've plotted every move of this day, [  Makes a fist.  ] this glorious day in Fire Nation history, and the only way we win is together. At the end of this day, you will have your honor back. You will have Father's love. You will have everything you want.",40
Iroh,"Zuko, I am begging you. [  Close-up of Zuko's face as he focuses from Azula back to Iroh.  ] Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want. [  Zuko resumes contemplating.  ]",40
Azula,You are free to choose.,40
Katara,We've got to find Sokka and Toph.,40
Toph,See any Dai Li agents nearby?,40
Sokka,"Nope, all clear.",40
Sokka,Let's go. [  Sokka grabs the Earth King's hand and follows Toph.  ],40
Kuei,[  While being guided by Sokka.  ] I'm not leaving without Bosco!,40
Katara,I thought you had changed! [  She grunts.  ],40
Zuko,I have changed.,40
Ty Lee,"[  To Bosco.  ] Come on, it's easy. You just walk on your front paws instead of your rear ones. [  She demonstrates.  ] Like this.",40
Toph,[  Sarcastically.  ] That  is  a nice trick.,40
Mai,"[  Uninterested, knowing she does not stand a chance.  ] Just take the bear.",40
Kuei,[  Runs to Bosco.  ] Bosco! [  Bosco growls happily.  ],40
Aang,There's too many. [  He looks at Katara.  ],40
Pathik,[  From Aang's memory.  ] The only way is to let her go.,40
Aang,"I'm sorry, Katara.",40
Iroh,You've got to get out of here! I'll hold them off as long as I can! [  Fires some blasts at Zuko and Azula.  ],40
Azula,"We've done it, Zuko. It's taken a hundred years, but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se.",40
Zuko,I betrayed Uncle.,40
Azula,"No, he betrayed you. [  She stands up from the throne.  ] Zuko, when you return home, Father will welcome you as a war hero.",40
Zuko,But I don't have the Avatar. What if Father doesn't restore my honor?,40
Azula,"He doesn't need to, Zuko. [  She puts a hand on Zuko's shoulder.  ] Today, you restored your own honor.",40
Kuei,The Earth Kingdom ... has fallen.,40
Aang,What happened? [  Sees the Fire Nation designs and flag and immediately assumes he has been captured.  ] Oh no!,41
Pipsqueak,"You hear something? [  Aang retreats behind the wall, where he dons a determined look and quickly steps out to send a weak air blast at them, which only ruffles their clothes, and moves past the hallway.  ] He's awake! [  The two begin chasing Aang, who struggles to escape.  ] Stop! Wait!",41
Aang,[  Confused.  ] Momo?,41
Toph,Twinkle Toes! That's got to be you!,41
Katara,"Aang, you're awake! [  The two race over to him.  ]",41
Aang,Are you sure? [  Rubs eyes.  ] I feel like I'm dreaming.,41
Katara,[  Hugs Aang.  ] You're not dreaming. You're finally awake.,41
Sokka,"[  Hugs Aang; is disguised as a Fire Nation guard.  ] Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy!",41
Aang,"Sokka? [  Breathes heavily, appears to be passing out.  ]",41
Toph,"Uh-oh, somebody catch him, he's going to-",41
Mai,Aren't you cold?,41
Zuko,"I've got a lot on my mind. It's been so long, over three years since I was home. I wonder what's changed. I wonder how  I've  changed.",41
Mai,"[  Yawns.  ] I just asked if you were cold, I didn't ask for your whole life story. [  Zuko frowns at her sarcastic response. Mai giggles and holds his face in her hands.  ] Stop worrying.",41
Aang,Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one who's completely out of it? [  Katara and Aang are left alone.  ],41
Katara,"You need to take it easy, okay? You got hurt pretty bad. [  Smiling at him.  ] I like your hair.",41
Aang,I have hair? [  Feels it.  ] How long was I out?,41
Katara,A few weeks.,41
Hakoda,Everything okay?,41
Katara,"[  Looking away, annoyed. Annoyed tone.  ] We're fine, Dad.",41
Hakoda,"[  To Aang.  ] I'm Hakoda, Katara and Sokka's father. [  Aang moves to shake his outstretched hand.  ]",41
Katara,"[  Placing her hands on Aang's shoulders stopping him.  ] He knows who you are. I just called you ""Dad"", didn't I?",41
Hakoda,I guess you're right.,41
Aang,"[  Removing Katara's hand he shakes Hakoda's hand.  ] Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda.",41
Hakoda,It's an honor to meet you.,41
Katara,"Great, great, so now you guys have finally met. So would you mind giving us a little privacy?",41
Hakoda,Of course. [  Walks away.  ],41
Aang,Are you mad at your dad or something? [  Katara looks at Hakoda leave with an expression of annoyance on her face.  ],41
Katara,"[  Confused look.  ] What, not at all. Why would you say that?",41
Katara,Maybe we should go upstairs. [  Helping Aang up.  ] You need a healing session.,41
Katara,Tell me where the pain feels most intense.,41
Aang,"Mmm, a little higher. Uhhh!",41
Aang,"Wow, you're definitely in the right area there.",41
Katara,I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there. [  Begins to remove the water.  ] Let me just see if I can-,41
Aang,"I went down! I didn't just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that. I was  gone  ! But you brought me back.",41
Katara,I just used the spirit water from the North Pole. I don't know what I did exactly.,41
Aang,[  Turning to look at her.  ] You saved me.,41
Katara,[  Placing a hand on the side of his face.  ] You need to rest.,41
Li,"Your Princess Azula, clever and beautiful, disguised herself as the enemy and entered the Earth Kingdom's Capital. In Ba Sing Se, she found her brother Zuko, and together they faced the Avatar ...",41
Lo and Li,And the Avatar fell! And the Earth Kingdom fell!,41
Li,Azula's agents quickly overtook the entire city. They went to Ba Sing Se's great walls ...,41
Lo and Li,And brought them down!,41
Li,"The armies of the Fire Nation surged through the walls and swarmed over Ba Sing Se, securing our victory.",41
Lo and Li,Now the heroes have returned home!,41
Lo,"Your princess, Azula ... [  Crowd cheers.  ]",41
Li,"And after three long years, your prince has returned ...",41
Lo and Li,Zuko!,41
Sokka,"After what happened at Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety. We flew back to Chameleon Bay where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men. [  Flashback preparing to leave by taking off his Earth King robes revealing traveling robes beneath.  ] The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone. [  Bosco is shown taking off his own attire and hat before Kuei jumps on Bosco and they set off.  ] Well, not completely alone. [  Cut back to Sokka continuing the story.  ] Soon, the bay was overrun by Fire Nation ships. Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise. Since then we've been traveling west. We crossed through the Serpent's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us.",41
Aang,So what now?,41
Hakoda,We've been working on a modified version of the invasion plan.,41
Katara,[  Sharply.  ] It's  Sokka's  invasion plan.,41
Hakoda,"Yes, Sokka's plan. We won't be able to mount a massive invasion without the Earth King's armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave the Fire Nation vulnerable.",41
Sokka,So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.,41
Pipsqueak,"[  Eating noodles with The Duke on his shoulder.  ] Good to see you again, Aang!",41
Sokka,"And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage! [  Whispers.  ] We have a secret... [  Looks at both of his sides.  ] You!",41
Aang,Me?,41
Sokka,"Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead! Isn't that great? [  Stands up and raises both of his fists triumphantly.  ]",41
Aang,The world thinks I'm dead? How is that good news? That's terrible!,41
Sokka,"[  Approaching Aang.  ] No, it's great! It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore! And even better, they won't be expecting you on the Day of Black Sun!",41
Aang,"No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. This is so messed up!",41
Aang,I'll handle this. The Avatar is back. [  Opens glider and grunts in pain.  ],41
Katara,"[  Approaching Aang.  ] Aang, wait! Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation!",41
Hakoda,Everyone just stay calm. [  He and Bato put their helmets on.  ] Bato and I will take care of this.,41
Aang,I hate not being able to do anything.,41
Toph,"Hopefully, you won't need to.",41
Fire Navy officer,"Commander, why are you off course? All Western Fleet ships are supposed to be moving toward Ba Sing Se to support the occupation!",41
Hakoda,"Actually, we're from the Eastern Fleet. We have orders to deliver some cargo.",41
Fire Navy officer,"Ahhh ... Eastern Fleet. Well, nice of Admiral Chan to let us know he was sending one of his ships our way.",41
Bato,"I'm sure Admiral Chan meant no disrespect, sir.",41
Fire Navy officer,"I mean, how hard is it to write a quick note and send a hawk our way?",41
Hakoda,"Next time, we'll send [  Bato and Hakoda glance at each other.  ] two hawks to make sure you get the message.",41
Guard,Sir ... Admiral Chan has been on leave for two months at Ember Island.,41
Fire Navy officer,What? Why doesn't anyone ever tell me anything? Something's not right; they should have known that. I think this is a captured ship. [  Whispering.  ] Just stay quiet until we're safely across the ramp. Then we'll sink this ship.,41
Toph,They know!,41
Azula,"You seem so downcast. Has Mai gotten to you already? Though actually, Mai has been in a strangely good mood lately.",41
Zuko,"I haven't seen Dad yet. I haven't seen him in three years, since I was banished.",41
Azula,So what?,41
Zuko,"So, I didn't capture the Avatar.",41
Azula,Who cares? The Avatar is dead ... [  Zuko looks away.  ] unless you think he somehow miraculously survived.,41
Katara,[  During flashback.  ] This is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole. It has special properties so I've been saving it for something important.,41
Zuko,No. There's no way he could have survived. [  They glare at each other.  ],41
Azula,"Well, then I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.",41
Toph,Load the Toph!,41
Katara,I'm gonna give us some cover!,41
Aang,I just can't stand by and do nothing! [  Runs out.  ],41
Sokka,"[  Following.  ] Aang, no! [  Grabs the staff.  ] You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret! Just let us handle this.",41
Aang,Fine. [  Grabs his staff and walks away.  ],41
Toph,How are we doing?,41
Sokka,"Things couldn't get much worse. [  A serpent rises from the water near their ship. Sokka turns around and looks at it in despar. Yelling.  ] The universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?",41
Toph,You make it too easy!,41
Sokka,"Thank you, the universe!",41
Toph,"Hey, Aang! We're going into town to find some dinner.",41
Aang,"[  Clutching his stomach.  ] Well, I am pretty hungry. Maybe dinner's a good idea.",41
Sokka,"Here, [  Offering a Fire Nation bandana.  ] tie this around your head. It will cover your arrow.",41
Aang,I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly! [  He lies back down.  ],41
Sokka,"Aang, come on. Be practical.",41
Katara,"[  Placing a hand on Sokka's shoulder.  ] You guys go ahead without us. We'll catch up to you. [  Toph and Sokka exit. Katara sits on Aang's bed, placing a hand on his shoulder.  ] I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much. You don't want people to think you failed.",41
Aang,"You're right, I don't. But the problem is, I did fail!",41
Katara,"Aang, that's not true.",41
Aang,[  Getting up.  ] It  is  true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there! But I lost. And now the Earth Kingdom is fallen for good.,41
Katara,"It's not for good. [  Getting up too.  ] Remember, there's still a plan. The invasion!",41
Aang,"And I hate the invasion plan, too! [  Rips down the Fire Nation flag covering his staff.  ] I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes! I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord. But now I know I need to do it alone.",41
Katara,[  Moving to comfort him.  ] Aang ...,41
Aang,"Katara, please! Just go ... please.",41
Katara,[  Exiting.  ] Is there anything you need?,41
Aang,I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back.,41
Katara,I brought you some food! [  Notices Aang has gone missing.  ] Oh no ... [  Drops the food tray and runs.  ],41
Ozai,"You've been away for a long time. I see the weight of your travels has changed you. You have redeemed yourself, my son. [  Approaches Zuko; the camera pans up to view Ozai's full face for the first time.  ] Welcome home.",41
Bato,I'll leave you two alone. [  Exits.  ],41
Hakoda,"What's wrong, Katara?",41
Katara,He left.,41
Hakoda,What?,41
Katara,"Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone, that it's all his responsibility.",41
Hakoda,Maybe that's his way of being brave.,41
Katara,"It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid! We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much we need him, too? How can he just leave us behind?",41
Hakoda,"You're talking about me too, aren't you?",41
Katara,"How could you leave us, Dad? [  Tears begin sliding down her face, and she attempts to wipe them away.  ] I mean, I know we had Gran-Gran, and she loved us, but we were just so lost without you.",41
Hakoda,"I'm so sorry, Katara. [  Pulls Katara into his arms.  ]",41
Katara,"[  Embraces Hakoda.  ] I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I'm so sad and angry and hurt!",41
Hakoda,"I love you more than anything. You and your brother are my entire world. I thought about you every day when I was gone and every night when I went to sleep, I would lie awake missing you so much it would ache.",41
Ozai,"I am proud of you, Prince Zuko. I am proud because you and your sister conquered Ba Sing Se. I am proud because when your loyalty was tested by your treacherous uncle, you did the right thing and captured the traitor. And I am proudest of all of your most legendary accomplishment: you slayed the Avatar.",41
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ] What did you hear?,41
Ozai,Azula told me everything. She said she was amazed and impressed at your power and ferocity at the moment of truth.,41
Aang,A blockade.,41
Zuko,Why'd you do it?,41
Azula,"[  Smiling, with her eyes still shut.  ] You're going to have to be a little more specific.",41
Zuko,Why did you tell Father that I was the one who killed the Avatar?,41
Azula,Can't this wait until the morning?,41
Zuko,It. Can't.,41
Azula,"[  Sighs and opens her eyes.  ] Fine. You seemed so worried about how Father would treat you because you hadn't captured the Avatar. I figured if I gave you the credit, you'd have nothing to worry about.",41
Zuko,But why?,41
Azula,[  Getting out of bed.  ] Call it a generous gesture. I wanted to thank you for your help and I was happy to share the glory.,41
Zuko,You're lying.,41
Azula,[  Walking past Zuko.  ] If you say so ...,41
Zuko,"You have another motive for doing this, I just haven't figured out what it is.",41
Azula,"Please Zuko, what ulterior motive could I have? What could I possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the Avatar? [  Approaching close to Zuko she places a hand on his shoulder.  ] Unless, somehow, the Avatar was actually alive. All that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness. But you said it yourself, that was impossible. [  Zuko begins to leave.  ] Sleep well, Zuzu.",41
Aang,"I'm not gonna make it. I failed. [  Within the lightning strikes, the spirit of Roku appears before Aang.  ] Roku?",41
Roku,"You haven't failed, Aang.",41
Aang,"But everyone thinks I'm dead again. They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war. I'm letting the whole world down.",41
Roku,"If anyone is to blame for the state of the world, it is me. I should have seen this war coming and prevented it. You inherited my problems and my mistakes. But I believe you are destined to redeem me and save the world.",41
Aang,I don't know.,41
Yue,"You already saved the world. And you'll save the world again, but you can't give up.",41
Aang,[  Determined.  ] You're right. I won't give up.,41
Katara,You're okay!,41
Aang,I have so much to do.,41
Katara,"I know, but you'll have our help.",41
Toph,"You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the Fire Nation, did you?",41
Aang,What about the invasion?,41
Sokka,We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse.,41
Toph,"[  Notices Aang's damaged staff has washed ashore.  ] Hey! What's ... oh, it's your glider.",41
Aang,"It's okay. If someone saw it, it would give away my identity. It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive.",41
Guard,Who's there?!,42
Aang,[  From inside the cloud.  ] I think I see a cave below.,42
Sokka,[  Commanding.  ] Sh! Keep quiet!,42
Sokka,"Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut. [  He reconnoiters again.  ]",42
Toph,"[  Cut to the Toph, Katara, and Aang standing in front of Sokka, who is reconnoitering. Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in.",42
Sokka,"[  Turning back toward the other three.  ] Hey, we're in enemy territory. [  He points above as camera zooms back to show four toucan puffins standing on a rock behind him.  ] Those are enemy birds.",42
Sokka,"Well, this is it. [  Cut to Sokka standing in front of the other three.  ] This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins. [  His head drops each time he says the word, ""cave"".  ] Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ...",42
Katara,"[  Cut to Katara, standing near Aang, from behind Sokka.  ] Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes.",42
Aang,"Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. [  Cut to Aang and Katara.  ] If we get Fire Nation disguises, [  Smiling.  ] we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.",42
Toph,"[  Cut to Toph, who is sitting down with her legs slightly folded.  ] Plus, they have real food out there. Does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers?",42
Sokka,"Looks like we got outvoted, sport. Let's get some new clothes.",42
Aang,[  Whispering.  ] I don't know about this. [  Cut to a view of Team Avatar from the clothes.  ] These clothes belong to somebody.,42
Katara,I call the silk robe! [  Jumps out from behind the rock wall and grabs two outfits.  ],42
Aang,But if it's essential to our survival ... then I call the suit! [  Jumps over the wall.  ],42
Aang,"[  Puts on a headband, revealing his whole new Fire Nation disguise.  ] Ta-dah! Normal kid.",42
Toph,"Hm ... I should probably wear shoes. But then I won't be able to see as well. [  Sits down.  ] Sorry, shoes! [  Pulls on the shoe, launching the sole at Sokka's face, leaving a red mark.  ] Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender.",42
Katara,[  Walks partially on camera.  ] How do I look? [  The camera pans from Katara's dress to her whole outfit.  ],42
Aang,"[  Blushing, scratching his head.  ] Uh ... your mom's necklace.",42
Katara,"Oh, [  Touches necklace.  ] oh, yeah. I guess it's pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn't it? [  Takes off the necklace and holds it in her hand.  ]",42
Aang,"I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, ""stay flamin'"". [  Walks around the building corner. To a man eating meat on a stick.  ] Greetings, my good hotman.",42
Fire Nation man,"[  Confused.  ] Uh, hi. [  Sokka shrugs at him as he passes.  ] I guess ...",42
Aang,"[  Looking at a meat display. Disappointedly.  ] Oh, we're going to a meat place?",42
Sokka,"Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat. Even the meat! [  Points at a hippo cow eating a piece of meat swarming with flies.  ]",42
Aang,You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage. [  Aang and Katara wave each at each other as the rest enter. Turns around to greet random people on the street.  ] Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman.,42
Male soldier,It's over. We caught you.,42
Aang,"[  Guiltily.  ] Who, me?",42
Male soldier,"It couldn't be more obvious that you don't belong here. [  Cut to Aang looking very nervous.  ] Next time you play hooky, you might wanna take off your school uniform.",42
Kwan,Oh. Is this a new mind ready for molding?,42
Aang,That's right. [  Knocking on his head.  ] Let the molding begin. [  The two guards turn away to leave.  ],42
Kwan,Wait a minute. [  The two guards turn back.  ] You're not from the Fire Nation. [  Walks around Aang.  ] Clearly you're from the colonies.,42
Aang,"Yeah, the colonies, of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom. [  The two guards walk away.  ]",42
Kwan,"Your etiquette is terrible. In the homeland, we bow to our elders. [  Walks in front of her desk.  ] Like so. [  Bows.  ]",42
Aang,"Sorry, ma'am.",42
Kwan,And we don't wear head coverings indoors.,42
Aang,Um ... I have a scar. It's really embarrassing.,42
Kwan,"Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you ""Mannerless Colony Slob""?",42
Aang,"[  Chuckles.  ] Just ""slob"" is fine. Or, uh, Kuzon. [  Camera pans out to Aang facing his classmates  .]",42
Aang,"[  Quietly.  ] We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun.",42
On Ji,[  From behind Aang.  ] Don't let the headmaster catch you with that monkey. [  The camera shifts to show her.  ],42
Aang,"[  Turns around, trying to act innocent.  ] What monkey?",42
On Ji,"Don't worry, I'm not a tattletale. My name's On Ji. I like your headband, by the way.",42
Hide,"[  Walks past Aang, slightly bumping him away and puts a hand around On Ji's shoulders.  ] On Ji, you don't have to baby-sit the new kid.",42
Aang,Wow. [  Bows.  ] You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about.,42
Hide,"That's right. Now listen, friend. I know you're from the colonies, so I'll say this slowly. [  Leans close to Aang, talking slowly.  ] On Ji is my girlfriend. [  Pokes Aang's chest.  ] Don't forget it.",42
Aang,[  Waving goodbye to On Ji and Hide.  ] It was nice meeting you.,42
Shoji,"[  Approaches Aang.  ] I don't believe it, he didn't beat you up. Not even a little.",42
Aang,I guess I'm just lucky.,42
Shoji,We were on our way to play hide and explode. You wanna come?,42
Aang,I'd love to.,42
Katara,[  Concernedly.  ] Where have you been? We've been worried sick.,42
Aang,[  Undoing his headband.  ] I got invited to play with some kids after school.,42
Sokka,[  Springs up to his feet in shock.  ] After  what  ?!,42
Aang,"I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow.",42
Sokka,[  With an exasperated facial expression.  ] Enrolled in  what  ?! [  Falls backward in disbelief.  ],42
Guard,"[  Readies his spear, with it pointed directly at Zuko.  ] You again? Stop where you are! [  Zuko raises his head, looking at the guard.  ] Prince Zuko ...",42
Zuko,"I'm going in for a visit. You're going to stand guard here, and  no one  is going to know about this. [  Zuko releases the guard, enters Iroh's cell, and approaches him.  ] Uncle, it's me. [  Iroh, sitting on the floor, turns away from Zuko with a scowl on his face.  ]",42
Sokka,"Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible.",42
Toph,"Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go to school for?",42
Aang,"Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai. [  Holds up the picture.  ] And here's one that I made out of noodles! [  Holds up his picture of Ozai.  ]",42
Sokka,"Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous.",42
Aang,I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow.,42
Sokka,"Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days.",42
Aang,"Flamey-O, Hotman! [  Runs off.  ]",42
Sokka,[  To Katara.  ] Flamey-O?,42
Zuko,"You brought this on yourself, you know. We could have returned together. You could have been a hero! [  Iroh shifts but does not look at him.  ] You have no right to judge me, Uncle. I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me. [  Iroh continues ignoring him.  ] You're not going to say anything? [  Kicks up a small stool and destroys it with firebending.  ] You're a crazy old man! You're crazy! And if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter! [  Zuko leaves, slamming the door behind him as Iroh's head drops slightly and he closes his eyes.  ]",42
Kwan,Good morning class. Recite the Fire Nation oath. [  Sits down at her desk.  ],42
Class,"[  Turns to a large painting of Ozai at the back of the class.  ] My life I give to my country, with my hands I fight for Fire Lord Ozai and our forefathers before him.",42
Aang,[  Glances around the room as the class recites the oath.  ] Fire Lord ... forefathers ...,42
Class,"With my mind I seek ways to better my country, and with my feet may our March of Civilization continue.",42
Aang,"Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah. [  The class snickers at him as they sit down as the teacher looks on with a stern expression.  ]",42
Kwan,"Since it's obviously  hilarious  to mock our national oath, we'll begin with a pop quiz on our great March of Civilization. [  The class groans and picks up their pens.  ] Question one: What year did Fire Lord Sozin battle the Air Nation army? [  Aang raises his hand.  ] Kuzon?",42
Aang,"Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush. [  The entire class stares at him, dumbfounded.  ]",42
Kwan,"Well, I don't know how  you  could possibly know more than our national history book. Unless you were there a hundred years ago.",42
Aang,I'll just write down my best guess.,42
Music teacher,Kuzon?,42
Aang,"[  Stopping.  ] I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist.",42
Music teacher,"No, child. That hullabaloo going on with your feet. Is that a nervous disorder?",42
Aang,"I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right?",42
Shoji,"Not really, no.",42
Music teacher,Dancing  is not conducive to a proper learning environment. Young people must have rigid discipline and order.,42
Aang,But what about expressing yourself?,42
Music teacher,"I know sometimes we're so ruled by our love for our nation that we can't control our own bodies. [  He puts his hand to his face at what he is saying before continuing on.  ] If you must, you may march in place quietly next time the urge hits you.",42
On Ji,"[  Waves at Aang.  ] Uh, hi, Kuzon. I really liked that crazy dance you were doing.",42
Aang,Thanks On Ji. I could show it to you again if you like. Ah! [  He jumps as a blast of fire hits the ground at his feet.  ],42
Hide,"What'd you say, colony trash? You're gonna show her something?",42
Aang,[  Nervously.  ] Just some dance movements.,42
Hide,"Nobody shows my On Ji anything, especially movements!",42
Headmaster,[  Angrily.  ] Picking fights on your second day? We need to have a conference to discuss your punishment. Bring your parents to my office after school.,42
Aang,[  Worriedly.  ] Parents? But-,42
Headmaster,Don't be late!,42
Headmaster,"Thank you for coming, Mr. and Mrs ... [  Shot changes to show Sokka in diguise with a large fake beard, and Katara in disguise with a different hairstyle and appearing pregnant, with Aang sitting between them.  ]",42
Sokka,"[  With an exaggerated accent.  ] Fire. [  Stroking his beard.  ] Wang Fire. [  Pointing to Katara.  ] This is my wife, Sapphire.",42
Katara,Sapphire Fire. Nice to meet you.,42
Headmaster,"Mr. and Mrs ... Fire, your son has been enrolled here for two days and he's already causing problems. He's argued with his history teacher, disrupted music class, and roughed up my star pupil.",42
Katara,My goodness! That doesn't sound like our Kuzon.,42
Headmaster,"That's what any mother would say, Ma'am. Nonetheless, you're forewarned; if he acts up one more time, I'll have him sent to reform school- [  Stands up.  ] by which I mean the coal mines. Are we clear?",42
Sokka,"Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce! [  Turns to Aang.  ] Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime! [  Aang and Katara are visibly alarmed.  ]",42
Headmaster,That's what I like to hear.,42
Mai,Orange is such an awful color.,42
Zuko,[  Snickers.  ] You're so beautiful when you hate the world.,42
Mai,I don't hate you.,42
Zuko,"I don't hate you too. [  They kiss, but are interrupted by Azula.  ]",42
Azula,"Ahem. [  They turn to look at her, clearly annoyed.  ] Zuko, could I have a word with you?",42
Zuko,Can't you see we're busy? [  They kiss again.  ],42
Azula,"Oh Mai, Ty Lee needs your help untangling her braid.",42
Mai,"[  Stands up, smiling.  ] Sounds pretty serious. [  Leaves, but throws an angry glance at Azula behind her back.  ]",42
Azula,"So, I've heard you've been to visit your uncle fatso in the prison tower.",42
Zuko,[  Standing angrily.  ] That guard told you.,42
Azula,No. You did. Just now.,42
Zuko,"[  Sits back down.  ] Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want, Azula?",42
Azula,"Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see Uncle, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just be careful, Dum-Dum.",42
Sokka,"[  Frontal shot, still acting as Wang Fire.  ] That settles it! No more school for you, young man! [  Strokes his beard.  ]",42
Aang,"I'm not ready to leave yet. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time.",42
Toph,Ha ha! [  Sokka glares at her.  ],42
Aang,"Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom.",42
Sokka,What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?,42
Aang,"I'm gonna throw them, [  Starts dancing.  ] a secret dance party! [  Everybody stares at Aang.  ]",42
Sokka,[  In Wang Fire voice.  ] Go to your room!,42
Sokka,[  Placing a candle.  ] I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so ... silly.,42
Aang,"Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork! [  Dances.  ]",42
Toph,[  Feeling their approach.  ] They're coming! Everyone stop bending.,42
Aang,"[  To Appa.  ] Sorry buddy, you should probably wait out back. [  Appa grumbles as Aang herds him into the back.  ] I know, you got fancier feet than anybody. And six of 'em! [  Turns around with his hands on his hips, grinning widely.  ]",42
Aang,"[  Jumps in front of the stage.  ] Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's! [  To himself.  ] Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving. [  He looks around at the kids standing shyly at the edge of the cave.  ]",42
Shoji,Now what do we do?,42
Aang,This is when you start dancing.,42
Male student #1,[  Shyly hiding his face behind his collar.  ] I don't think my parents want me dancing in a cave ...,42
Male student #2,[  Runs in front of the camera.  ] Yeah! What if someone finds out?! [  Looks around nervously before exiting left.  ],42
Aang,"Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.",42
Shoji,"Maybe it was different in the colonies, Kuzon, but we don't do that here.",42
Aang,"Sure you do, you have for generations! It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'. [  The students ooh and aah as Aang runs low to the ground.  ] And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'.",42
Toph,[  To Katara.  ] Who knew Twinkle Toes could dance?,42
Zuko,"[  Sliding food into Iroh's cell as Iroh keeps his back to him.  ] I brought you some komodo chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food. I admit it, I have everything I always wanted, but it's not as all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice. [  Grips the bars.  ] I think the Avatar is still alive, I  know  he's out there, I'm losing my mind. [  Iroh does not respond. Desperately.  ] Please, Uncle, I'm so confused I need your help. [  Iroh still has nothing to say to him. Angrily.  ] Forget it, I'll solve it myself! Waste away in here for all I care! [  He glances back before leaving, and a tear slides down Iroh's face.  ]",42
Aang,And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se. [  He starts tapping his feet from side to side and On Ji joins him.  ],42
Sokka,"[  Watching as Aang dances with On Ji.  ] Wow, they look pretty good together.",42
Katara,"[  Barely hiding her envy as she looks away.  ] Eh, if that's what you like ... [  She looks back surreptitiously.  ]",42
Aang,"Yeah, that's it! That's the sound of happy feet. [  The rest of the kids start dancing with them.  ] All right, go with that! Everybody freestyle!",42
Katara,"[  Looks away nervously.  ] I don't know, Aang. [  Starts nervously pulling her hair.  ] These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I-I'm not sure that I know how to-",42
Aang,[  Smiling.  ] Take my hand.,42
Katara,[  Smiles back.  ] Okay.,42
Katara,"[  Looking around.  ] Aang, everyone's watching.",42
Aang,Don't worry about them. [  Smiles.  ] It's just you and me right now.,42
Headmaster,"It  is  a dancing party. [  Turns to Hide standing behind him.  ] You did the right thing by telling me, Hide.",42
Hide,"[  Bows.  ] Anytime, Headmaster sir.",42
Male student #1,"[  Waving a hand in the air.  ] This is incredible! It's like my inhibitions just disappear! [  He sees the Headmaster come into the cave, and immediately stops dancing and attempts to shrink into his robes.  ] Okay, they're back again.",42
Headmaster,[  Pointing.  ] He's the one we want! The boy with the headband!,42
Aang,"Uh-oh. [  Aang starts running away through the crowd as the soldiers chase him. One soldier sees a boy with a headband, and grabs him.  ]",42
Male soldier #1,"Gotcha! [  The boy turns, but the guard is confused upon seeing a different boy there.  ]",42
Shoji,Looking for me?,42
Headmaster,That's not the one. He's here somewhere. Don't let him leave the cave!,42
On Ji,Yes?,42
Male student #2,[  Picking his nose.  ] Hi there.,42
Male student #1,How're we doing?,42
Female student #1,Looking for someone?,42
On Ji,Who are you looking for?,42
Female Student #1,Do you need something?,42
Student,Over here.,42
Headmaster,"[  To one of the soldiers, who starts dancing.  ] Stop that! [  To another soldier, who is tapping her foot.  ] Stop that!",42
Katara,"We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache, now.",42
Sokka,"[  He is seen with his Wang Fire mustache on and begins stroking it.  ] Oh, no, I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin.",42
Toph,"[  To Aang.  ] Way to go, dancy pants. I think you really  did  help those kids, you taught them to be free.",42
Aang,"I don't know, it was just a dance party, that's all.",42
Katara,"Well, that was some dance party Aang. [  She kisses him on the cheek, and Aang blushes.  ]",42
Sokka,"[  Clapping lightly.  ] Flamey-O, sir ... Flamey-O.",42
Zuko,"You're sure you weren't followed? I've heard about you. They say you're good at what you do, and even better at keeping secrets. The Avatar is alive. I want you to find him, and end him.",42
Aang,"Momo! [  Dives into the water.  ] Oh Momo! [  Dives again and Momo flies to Aang.  ] Hahahahaha! You found me, buddy! [  Looks down at the water in distaste and airbends up to Appa's saddle, where he stands dripping in sludge.  ] Hey guys, I think this river's polluted. [  Airbends mud off himself, splattering the rest of Team Avatar with mud, which causes them to cry out in disgust.  ]",43
Toph,"[  Tastes mud on her mouth, and spits.  ] Pah! Plegh! [  Aang airbends again, blowing the rest of the mud back into the river and messing up their hair.  ]",43
Sokka,"Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing skills are off the hook! [  Holds up a fishing hook. The gang is unamused as Aang sits back down.  ] Get it? Like a fishing hook? [  Grinning.  ]",43
Toph,[  Countering.  ] Too bad your skills aren't  on  the hook.,43
Katara,"It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food, [  Unrolls a long scroll in front of her.  ] assuming that'll fit into Sokka's  master  schedule.",43
Sokka,Hmmm ... It's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today.,43
Aang,"Hey, maybe we can get food there! [  Points at a village in the middle of the river.  ]",43
Aang,"Now you look just like a little hill with horns! Bye, buddy!",43
Toph,I don't feel anything. Where is the village?,43
Sokka,It's in the middle of the river! [  Pointing at the village.  ],43
Dock,Sure is! My name's Dock. Mind if I ask who you are?,43
Katara,We're um ... from the Earth Kingdom colonies.,43
Dock,"Wow ... Colonials. Hop on, I give you ride in the town.",43
Katara,Why do you guys live on the river? [  Looking at the village.  ],43
Dock,"[  Turns his paddle to the right side, pointing at the Fire Nation factory.  ] Because we're a fishing town. At least that's how it was before the factory moved in. [  Closer shot of the Fire Nation factory and pans down.  ] Army makes their metal there. Moved in a few years ago and started gunking up our river. [  Shot changes back to the ferry. Aang and Katara glance sadly at each other.  ] Now our little village is struggling to survive.",43
Aang,"Thanks for the ride! [  Waves his hand to Dock, who waves back.  ]",43
Katara,"[  Cut to three villagers sitting on a porch.  ] Look at this place. [  Cut to two other villagers, an old man and a young boy.  ] It's so sad. [  Cut back to Katara looking down.  ] We  have  to do something to help.",43
Sokka,"No, we can't waste our time here. We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own.",43
Katara,[  Chases Sokka and grabs his shoulder.  ] These people are starving! But you'd turn your back on them? [  Puts her hands on her hips.  ] How can you be so cold and heartless?,43
Sokka,"[  Shot changes to show their argument from the river as a barrel bobs up and down.  ] I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic. We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord. [  Aang guides Toph toward the arguing siblings.  ]",43
Toph,"[  Covering Sokka's mouth with her hand.  ] Hey, loud mouths! Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about [  Quietly.  ] ""taking out the Fire Lord.""",43
Sokka,"Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first.",43
Katara,[  Reluctantly.  ] I guess so. [  Looks annoyed.  ],43
Aang,"Let's just get what we need and go. [  Smiling to Katara, who smiles back.  ]",43
Sokka,"Hey, Dock. You work here too?",43
Xu,I'm not Dock. I'm Xu! Dock's my brother.,43
Aang,But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes. [  Close-up of his hat.  ] The only difference is your hat.,43
Xu,"[  Camera zooms out to Xu talking.  ] Dock works on the docks. That's why we call him, ""Dock"", and I work in the shop, that's why they call me, ""Xu""!",43
Aang,I don't get it.,43
Xu,"Me neither. [  Jumps down behind the counter and pulls out a crate filled with rancid gray seafood.  ] What I can getcha? [  Katara, Aang, and Sokka look disgusted.  ] Hey, I'll give you a special deal. If you buy three fish, I'll give you a clam for free. [  Sokka pushes a clam, and mucus splashes out from it.  ]",43
Sokka,[  Picks up three fish. Carefully.  ] We'll just take the fish. [  Xu takes the fish.  ] Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore? [  Xu jumps down behind the counter and jumps up wearing Dock's hat.  ],43
Dock,"Hey, colonials! My brother says you need a lift. [  Jumps over the counter, and walks to the dock.  ]",43
Little boy,Can you spare some food?,43
Katara,"[  Touched.  ] I wish I could help more. [  Gives the boy a fish, and the boy bows to her and leaves to give the fish to his sick mother.  ]",43
Sokka,Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track.,43
Toph,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Finagle away, oh schedule master.",43
Sokka,"Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day.",43
Katara,Forty  -three  minutes?,43
Sokka,"[  Pointing to various spots on his schedule.  ] Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse, which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!",43
Toph,Well  I'm  not waking up early.,43
Sokka,Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.,43
Aang,What?,43
Katara,No way!,43
Toph,Forget it!,43
Sokka,"[  Gets a sly look on his face.  ] I got it, how's this from now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time.",43
Sokka,"Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning.",43
Aang,What's the matter Katara?,43
Katara,I think Appa's sick.,43
Sokka,[  Panicking.  ] What? Appa's sick? That's awful!,43
Toph,"Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much.",43
Sokka,"Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now. [  Pulls out his schedule. He stops and looks at the group. Cut to a shot of the rest of the gang giving him the evil eye, and he quickly changes his tone, rushing solicitously to Appa's side.  ] And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well.",43
Toph,He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water.,43
Aang,"He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy? [  Appa groans and Aang pulls out Appa's purple tongue.  ] His tongue is purple! That can't be good. Katara, can you heal him?",43
Katara,It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in town.,43
Toph,"Is it just me, or does this place seem different?",43
Aang,"Yeah, are the people ... happier?",43
Sokka,"Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?",43
Xu,"[  Drinks from a ladle.  ] Ah, something amazing happened last night. Food was delivered to our village by a mysterious and wonderful person ... the Painted Lady.",43
Katara,The Painted who now?,43
Xu,The Painted Lady. [  He places a miniature statuette of the spirit down on the counter.  ] She's part of our town's lore. They say she's a river spirit who watches over our town in times of need. I always thought she was just a legend. Until now.,43
Sokka,"See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them. All we need is medicine for our sick friend.",43
Xu,"Medicine? Sorry, all the medicine we have goes to the factory. That's why there's so many sick people in our village.",43
Katara,Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest.,43
Sokka,[  Sighs.  ] I guess you're right. You got any more food to sell?,43
Xu,"[  Goes under the counter and emerges holding a fish in each hand.  ] Would you like the one-headed fish, or the two-headed fish? [  He turns the fish on the left sideways to show the second head.  ]",43
Sokka,[  Ponders.  ] Two-headed! [  The rest of the group lowers their heads and small sweat drops appear.  ] What? You get more for your money that way! [  Holds up the polluted fish.  ],43
Little boy,"Thank you, Painted Lady.",43
Sokka,"Hi, Dock. Is Xu around?",43
Dock/Xu,"Let me check ... [  He runs around the shop and ducks beneath the counter to switch hats.  ] Hey there! Back again, are ya?",43
Toph,[  Pushes Sokka away.  ] We need more food. [  Slams the money on the counter.  ] Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better.,43
Xu,"Oh, well, that's too bad. Maybe if you guys are lucky, the Painted Lady will visit you in the night, and heal your friend.",43
Sokka,"[  Picks up the clams. Sarcastically.  ] And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along.",43
Xu,"[  Not getting the sarcasm. Sokka looks annoyed now.  ] Yeah, maybe! You know, last night she visited us again. Healed most of our sick folks.",43
Aang,Is that why this place seems so festive?,43
Dock,"Yep, it's all because of the Painted Lady.",43
Katara,Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ... spirit?,43
Sokka,"Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was.",43
Katara,[  Gets annoyed.  ] Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are.,43
Sokka,"Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory. [  He makes mocking gestures to indicate explosive spirit magic. He crosses his arms with a smile. Katara gets even more annoyed. The screen pans to the right to show Aang who has his arms crossed not impressed.  ]",43
Aang,"Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like ... [  He waves his body with arms in the air making similar gestures to indicate spirit magic. Katara storms away from the two.  ]",43
Aang and Sokka,[  Sokka wraps and arm over Aang's shoulder and the two combined their little imitation but far more ridiculous.  ] Wooooooooo ... [  Sokka chuckles.  ],43
Aang,"What's the matter, buddy? [  Katara leaves Team Avatar.  ] It's her! [  Excited, waves his hand to Katara and puts on his headband.  ] Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!",43
Aang,"[  Jumps up the hill.  ] Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule. [  Continues to follow her down the hill as she crosses the river.  ] Wait! But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine! [  Aang freezes some water to form stepping stones to cross the river.  ] I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends! [  Katara moves faster, and Aang jumps on a wooden bridge. Katara runs out of the river onto the docks and notices Aang's reflection in the water. She looks up and sees Aang running across a roof.  ] Heeey! [  He suddenly hits a pole, Katara flinches and feels sorry for him but continues on across the river to the other side. She stops to look out at the village thinking she is safe but Aang drops in front of her.  ] My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar. [  Lifts his headband and points at his arrow.  ]",43
Katara,"[  Using a disguised voice.  ] Well, hello Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy.",43
Aang,"Yeah, me too. I hate that. [  Looks at Katara's face from behind the veil.  ] You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive. [  Looks at Katara suspiciously. Tries to look under the hat.  ]",43
Katara,"[  Giggles nervously.  ] Thank you, but-",43
Aang,You seem familiar too.,43
Katara,A lot of people say that.,43
Aang,"[  Suspicious.  ] No, you  really  seem familiar.",43
Katara,"Look, I really should get going. [  Covers her face and runs, but Aang uses his airbending and blasts her hat up into the air, exposing her.  ]",43
Aang,Katara?,43
Katara,"[  Guiltily.  ] Hi, Aang.",43
Aang,[  Shocked.  ] You're the Painted Lady? [  Pointing at Katara.  ] But how?,43
Katara,"I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village. [  Takes her hat off.  ] But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her. [  Drops her hat on the ground.  ]",43
Aang,"So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait, is Appa even sick?",43
Katara,"He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine!",43
Aang,"I can't believe you lied to everyone, so you could help these people.",43
Katara,"I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have ...",43
Aang,"[  Happily.  ] No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero!",43
Katara,"Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do.",43
Aang,You wanna destroy this factory?,43
Katara,"Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently.",43
Katara,"Shhh! [  Quietly.  ] We don't wanna wake Sokka. [  She turns and sees that Sokka and Toph are awake.  ] Hi, Sokka, we were just out on a morning walk!",43
Sokka,"[  Angrily and disappointed.  ] Oh, really? A morning walk? [  Dumps the hay out of Katara's sleeping bag.  ] I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him [  Sticks out his own tongue.  ] purpleising tongue berries! [  Toph sticks out her tongue and shows that it is purple and holds up a bag of berries which Momo starts eating.  ] Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now!",43
Sokka,And how long did you know about this?,43
Aang,"[  Defensively.  ] Hey, I just found out this morning!",43
Toph,[  Approaching and kneeling down with the others.  ] What's going on?,43
Aang,Fire Nation soldiers are heading toward the village!,43
Sokka,[  To Katara.  ] What did you do?,43
Katara,I kind of destroyed their factory.,43
Sokka,You  what  ?,43
Katara,[  Defensively.  ] It was  your  idea!,43
Sokka,I was joking! I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises! [  Slaps his forehead.  ] Did you even think this through? The army is gonna blame the villagers! They're headed there right now to get revenge!,43
Katara,"Well, what was I supposed to do?",43
Sokka,Leave! Do nothing!,43
Katara,"[  Angrily.  ] No, I will never,  ever  turn my back on people who need me! [  Gets up.  ] I'm going down to that village, and I am gonna do whatever I can.",43
Sokka,"Wait! I'm coming, too.",43
Katara,I thought you didn't want to help.,43
Sokka,"You need me, and I will never turn my back on you.",43
Katara,"Sokka, you really do have a heart. [  The two hug.  ]",43
Aang,"[  Wiping away tears.  ] He really does have a heart, doesn't he?",43
Mung,"I thought we could live as neighbors, in peace. But I guess I was wrong. You steal our food, our medicine ... and then you destroy our factory.",43
Dock/Xu,"[  Pops out of the crowd wearing Dock hat.  ] We didn't do any of that. [  Pops out in a different place wearing his Xu hat.  ] Yeah, the Painted Lady brought us food. She's the one that healed our sick, not your medicine.",43
Mung,"[  Holding a statuette.  ] Oh, right, the mysterious Painted Lady did it. And I suppose she drew the army emblem on your containers, too. [  Throws the statuette at the container, smashing it. The crowd gasps.  ] This is a town of thieves and liars! [  Firebends a blast at a house. Mockingly.  ] Where's your Painted Lady now? We're going to cure the world of this wretched village.",43
Mung,Light it again!,43
Female Fire Nation soldier,Look at that! Where's it coming from?,43
Male Fire Nation soldier,I don't know. Something strange is going on.,43
Little boy,It's the Painted Lady. [  Grins slyly. Ominous tone.  ] She's coming.,43
Mung,There is no Painted Lady!,43
Female Fire Nation soldier,What is that sound?,43
Male Fire Nation soldier,Maybe it  is  her.,43
Mung,"Do something! [  Pushes his soldiers forward. As they timidly draw near, they are rattled by a blast of airbending. Aang is shown hiding beneath the dock. The two soldiers run off. To the remaining soldiers.  ] Stand your ground! [  Katara waterbends two jet skis into a nearby cliff. As she raises her hand to wreak further damage, the soldiers jump into the remaining jet skis and speed off, leaving Mung.  ] I'll take care of you myself.",43
Katara,Leave this village and  never  come back.,43
Little boy,I knew you'd come.,43
Villager #1,Thank you!,43
Villager #2,"Painted Lady, you're the best!",43
Dock,"Me and my brothers really owe you a lot. [  Looking at her and her faded Painted Lady marks.  ] Hey, wait a minute! I know you! You're not the Painted Lady, you're that colonial girl!",43
Little boy,"Yeah, you're the lady that gave me a fish.",43
Dock,[  Angrily.  ] You've been tricking us. You're a waterbender!,43
Villager #3,She's a waterbender!,43
Villager #4,How dare you act like our Painted Lady!,43
Sokka,"Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her!",43
Katara,"Sokka, it's okay. [  She steps forward and moves Sokka back. To the villagers.  ] I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself.",43
Dock,"She's right, but what should we do?",43
Toph,[  Pops out from behind the little boy's mother and uses a lower voice.  ] Maybe we can clean the river!,43
Dock,"Yeah, we can clean the river! [  The crowd cheers.  ] Thank you. You know, you're not so bad for a waterbender.",43
Sokka,"You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?",43
Dock,"No problem. Keeping my mouth shut is a personal specialty. My brother Xu, on the other hand, ohh, he's a blabbermouth. [  Sokka facepalms.  ]",43
Katara,"So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?",43
Dock,"No, ma'am. I'm going to get my other brother, Bushi. He loves cleaning rivers. [  Dock brazenly switches hats right in front of them.  ] All right, I'm Bushi! Let's get some river cleaning done!",43
Aang,"Aha, I knew it! I knew you were the same guy. You're the shop owner  and  the boat guy.",43
Dock,"Oh, you must be talking about my brothers, Dock and Xu.",43
Aang,"[  Annoyed.  ] No, I just saw you! You switched hats and called yourself a different name!",43
Dock,"[  Annoyed.  ] Oh, you know who does that? My brother, Dock. [  Conspiratorial whisper.  ] He's crazy. [  Goes off chuckling.  ]",43
Painted Lady,Thank you. [  Slowly disappears.  ],43
Katara,"Wow, this is amazing to watch.",44
Sokka,Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are.,44
Toph,"[  Close-up. Causally.  ] Eh, you've seen nothing once, you've seen it a thousand times.",44
Sokka,"Oh man, [  Close-up. Standing.  ] you've  never  not seen anything like this.",44
Katara,The fire is gonna destroy that town!,44
Aang,Not if we can stop it!,44
Katara,"[  Jumps onto Appa's head, taking the reins.  ] There's a creek over here. I'll bend the water onto the fire. [  Signals Appa to take off.  ]",44
Aang,"[  Frontal view of Toph, Sokka, and Aang.  ] Toph, let's make a trench to stop the fire from coming any closer.",44
Sokka,What should I do?,44
Aang,"[  Slight pause, points at Momo.  ] Keep an eye on Momo.",44
Sokka,"So what, I'm just a lemur sitter? [  Pets Momo; sarcastically.  ] There, there, feel better?",44
Aang,"Sokka, stand clear!",44
Sokka,"[  Side-view of the crash site with Sokka and Momo looking left.  ] Right. [  Picks up Momo and makes to move away.  ] Staying clear, got it.",44
Aang,"Good work, everybody.",44
Warden Poon,"Look at you, [  Frontal view.  ] you're just a fat, disgusting old man. [  Panning aerial view from behind.  ] You do nothing, you say nothing, you just eat and roll around in your own filth like a pig.

Aang,These people have no idea [  Closer side-view of the three.  ] how close they were to getting toasted last night.,44
Toph,"Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is that we don't get the hero worship anymore. I miss the love.",44
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Boo-hoo, [  Shot of Sokka from behind looking back.  ] poor heroes. [  Turns away.  ]",44
Katara,What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.,44
Sokka,"It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around and [  Side-view of Toph, Aang and Katara.  ] making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, okay? [  View of Sokka from behind.  ] I can't  do  anything.",44
Katara,That's not true. No one can read a map like you.,44
Toph,I can't read at all!,44
Aang,"Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time? [  Frontal view of Katara and Aang.  ] I mean, look at Katara's hair, right? What's up with that?",44
Katara,What? What's wrong with my hair? [  Blushes.  ],44
Aang,[  Realizing his mistake.  ] Nothing. I was just trying to ...,44
Sokka,"Look, I appreciate the effort, [  Cut to view from behind.  ] but the fact is each of you is so amazing and so special and I'm ... not. [  Side-view close-up.  ] I'm just the guy in the group who's regular.",44
Katara,"[  Approaches and sits next to him.  ] I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know, none of us see you that way. [  Frontal view of the two. Looks down for a moment before putting her hand on his shoulder.  ] I know something that's going to make you feel better.",44
Sokka,[  Side-view. Sadly.  ] You do?,44
Sokka,"Shopping! [  Clapping excitedly. Runs toward the camera. Cut to side-view as he approaches to view some weapons.  ] Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling.

Aang,"[  Off-screen.  ] What do you think? [  Cut to Aang as the camera pans up to see him wearing strange, scary armor.  ] Pretty slick, huh? [  Close-up of Katara with a scared and surprised expression. Side-view of Katara approaching Aang, holding a hand up to avoid the glare coming off Aang's helmet.  ] All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword.",44
Katara,What's a wind sword?,44
Aang,"It's where I get a sword handle and then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade. [  Raises a sword handle, swishing it around like a sword.  ] Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.",44
Katara,[  Unconvincingly.  ] Yeah ... nice.,44
Aang,I'll just stick to what I got.,44
Sokka,[  Close-up.  ] Ooh! [  Walks to the sword. Side-view of Sokka inspecting the sword.  ]  That's  what Sokka's talking about.,44
Weapons store shopkeeper,"You have a good eye. [  Aerial view of Sokka as shopkeeper approaches.  ] That's an original from Piandao, [  Katara, Toph and Aang approach.  ] the greatest swordsmaster and sword maker in Fire Nation history.

Aang,"[  Side-view of group.  ] That's it! That's what you needed all along, Sokka.",44
Sokka,A sword?,44
Aang,"Not the sword, a master. [  Sokka takes the sword from the rack.  ] We've all had masters to help us get better. You should see if you can study with Piandao.",44
Katara,[  Frontal view of Sokka with Katara behind.  ] That's a great idea. I could've never gotten to where I am without Master Pakku. Everyone needs a teacher.,44
Toph,"[  Side-view of group.  ] I learned from badgermoles. They don't talk, but they're still good teachers.",44
Sokka,"[  Close-up. Pulling out the blade, inspecting it.  ] It would be nice to be a master sword fighter. All right, I'll talk to him.",44
Fat,[  A little annoyed.  ] Can I help you?,44
Sokka,I've come to train with the master.,44
Fat,[  Side-view of both.  ] You should know The Master turns almost everyone away. [  Holds hand out in front of Sokka.  ] What did you bring him to prove your worth?,44
Sokka,"[  Frontal view.  ] Well, uhh ... [  Feels around, patting his clothes for something to offer.  ]",44
Fat,[  Frontal view.  ] Right ... [  Shakes head sadly.  ] Let's get this over with.,44
Sokka,"Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword.",44
Piandao,Sokka. That's an unusual name.,44
Sokka,"[  Frontal view. Nervously.  ] Oh, uh, really, uh where I come from, the Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name... for Fire Nation colonials.",44
Piandao,[  Side-view. Writing calligraphy on a piece of parchment.  ] Let me guess. You've come hundreds of miles from your little village where you're the best swordsman in town. And you think you deserve to learn from the master.,44
Sokka,"[  Frontal view.  ] Well, actually, I've been all over the world.",44
Piandao,"[  Side-view of his arm and hand as he continues to write. Knowingly.  ] Yep, here we go.",44
Sokka,[  Frontal view.  ] And I know one thing for sure: [  Gets down on his knees and hangs his head.  ] I have a lot to learn.,44
Piandao,[  Shot from behind. Glancing back.  ] You're not doing a very good job of selling yourself.,44
Sokka,"[  Side-view of room.  ] I know. Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth. [  Close-up.  ] But the truth is... I don't know if I am worthy.",44
Piandao,"[  Close-up side-view.  ] Hm, I see. [  Smiles and turns his head. Cut to his hand picking up his sword.  ] Well, then, [  Close-up of Sokka.  ] let's find out together how worthy you are.",44
Piandao,I  will  train you.,44
Piandao,[  Frontal view.  ] The first thing you must learn is that your weapon is an extension of yourself. [  Cut further away as he unsheathes his sword and begins performing a sword form.  ] You must think of it as another part of your own body.,44
Sokka,[  Close-up.  ] Like a second head.,44
Piandao,"[  Frontal view.  ] Well, more like an extra-long, really sharp arm. [  Side-view of both. Continuing his demonstration.  ] The sword is a simple tool, but in the hands of a master it becomes [  Close-up.  ] the most versatile of weapons, [  Frontal view from below. Sheathes his sword and assumes a stance.  ] and just as the imagination is limitless, [  Close-up of Sokka smiling in amazement.  ] so too are the possibilities of the sword.",44
Aang,What should we do today‌?,44
Toph,"I'm tapped out. I already picked my toes, twice.",44
Aang,Twice?,44
Toph,"The first time was for cleaning, but the second time's just for the [  Wiggles her toes.  ] sweet picking sensation!",44
Katara,Sokka's been in charge of the schedule. I'm not sure what we should be doing.,44
Toph,"[  Frontal view of Aang with Toph behind. Picking her nose.  ] Plus, it's so hot today.",44
Aang,[  Attempting to joke.  ] How hot is it?,44
Toph,I dunno. Real hot‌?,44
Katara,"[  Camera pans across to show Katara.  ] I-It's so hot, it's  so  hot ... Momo is shedding like Appa. [  Pets Momo and flicks tufts of fur from her fingers.  ] Huh, huh‌?",44
Aang,I guess the jokes don't run in the family.,44
Katara,"Oh, everyone's a critic.",44
Piandao,"The warrior practices a variety of arts to keep his mind sharp and fluid. [  Flattens out a piece of paper on the table.  ] The first you will learn is calligraphy.

Sokka,[  Close-up. Skeptical.  ] Writing my name will make me a better swordsman‌?,44
Piandao,"[  Takes the brush and positions it correctly in Sokka's hand. Cut to a wide shot of both.  ] When you write your name, you stamp the paper with your identity. You must learn to use your sword to stamp your identity on a battlefield. [  Sokka holds his sleeve back. Cut to close-up of the ink as Sokka dips the brush in to it. Cut to frontal view of Sokka readying himself to paint as Piandao looks on.  ] Remember, you cannot take back a stroke of the brush, or a stroke of the sword.",44
Piandao,[  Close-up as he moves forward.  ] You are getting ink on your face.,44
Sokka,"[  Frontal view of both.  ] I am? [  Looks at the brush.  ] I am! So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?",44
Piandao,Landscape painting teaches a warrior to hold the lay of the land in his mind.,44
Piandao,"In battle, you only have an instant to take everything in.",44
Piandao,"Now, paint it.",44
Piandao,And no peeking.,44
Sokka,I'm finished!,44
Piandao,[  Frontal view.  ] You added a rainbow.,44
Sokka,[  Frontal view. Worried.  ] Is that ok‌ay?,44
Piandao,[  Off-screen.  ] Sokka.,44
Piandao,[  Close-up.  ] Concentrate on what you're doing.,44
Piandao,Rock gardening teaches the warrior to manipulate his surroundings and use them to his advantage.,44
Sokka,"Hm, manipulate them to my advantage ... oh!",44
Sokka,"Hey, would you mind grabbing a cold drink for me‌?",44
Piandao,"I'll take a slice of lemon in mine, please.",44
Warden Poon,What's going on in there‌?,44
Warden Poon,Crazy old man.,44
Katara,So where are we going next‌? [  Cut to a shot of Aang and Katara sitting around a map of the Fire Nation. Pointing to the map.  ] We're starting from here ...,44
Aang,"[  Pointing at a different spot.  ] No, we're over on this island.",44
Toph,[  Lying down.  ] You noodle-brains don't know what you're doing. I miss Sokka.,44
Katara,"Ooh, I got one: if you miss him so much, why don't you marry him‌?",44
Piandao,You've had a good first day of training.,44
Sokka,[  Frontal view.  ] I have‌? But I thought I messed up every single thing we worked on!,44
Piandao,[  Frontal view of feet. Camera pans up to his face.  ] You messed things up in a very special way. You are ready for a real sword.,44
Sokka,[  Frontal view. Excited.  ] Are you giving me one of yours‌?,44
Piandao,[  Frontal view.  ] No.,44
Piandao,"[  Frontal view. Camera zooms in on his face.  ] Your sword must be an extension of yourself. So tomorrow, you will make your own sword.",44
Piandao,Choosing the correct material is the most important step in crafting a sword. [  Close-up and zooms out showing the steel in front of him.  ] You must trust your steel with your life. Choose carefully.,44
Sokka,"Master, [  Side-view of Sokka looking at Piandao.  ] would it be possible for me to leave and bring back a special material for my sword‌?",44
Piandao,[  Side-view of Piandao looking at Sokka.  ] I wouldn't have it any other way.,44

Sokka,"[  Overhead view from behind Piandao.  ] Oh, these are my friends. Just other good Fire Nation folks. [  They bow to Piandao. Cut to Piandao, who bows back. The camera zooms out to show the meteorite and Sokka.  ] Do you think we can make a sword out of a meteorite‌?",44
Piandao,[  Close-up.  ] We'll make a sword unlike any other in the world.,44
Piandao,"Sokka, when you first arrived, you were so unsure. You even seemed down on yourself. [  Frontal view of Piandao as the camera pans across to the right revealing Fat.  ] But I saw something in you right away. [  Side-view of Sokka.  ] I saw a heart as strong as a lion turtle, and twice as big. [  Side-view of the room.  ] And as we trained, it wasn't your skills that impressed me. [  Fat kneels to Piandao and gives him the sword. Frontal view of Piandao as he turns back to face the camera.  ] No, it certainly wasn't your skills. [  Brief close-up of Sokka, who looks down in shame, before cutting back to a close-up of Piandao.  ] You showed something beyond that. [  Unsheathes the sword, showing its black blade. Cut to side-view of Piandao as the camera zooms out and follows the blade as he strikes out to the side.  ] Creativity, versatility, [  Frontal view of Sokka with the sword in the foreground.  ] intelligence ...

[  Kneels and presents the sword to Sokka. Cut to frontal view of Sokka, from Piandao's perspective, who takes it.  ] You told me you didn't know if you were worthy, [  Close-up shot as he stands up.  ] but I believe that you are more worthy than any man I have ever trained.",44
Sokka,"I'm sorry, Master. You're wrong. [  Close-up of Piandao.  ] I am not worthy. [  Side-view of Sokka.  ] I'm not who you think I am. I'm not from the Fire Nation. I'm from the Southern Water Tribe. [  Cut to side-view of Aang, Katara, and Toph who all gawk at Sokka with shock and disbelief.

Piandao,Excellent! [  Close-up.  ] Using your superior agility against an older opponent ... smart.,44
Piandao,Good use of terrain ... fighting from the high ground.,44
Piandao,"Yes, use your surroundings. [  Piandao deflects the attacks as Sokka runs away. Sokka grabs two stalks and pulls them back before releasing them. They whip around at Piandao, who slices through them.  ] Make them fight for you!",44
Piandao,Very resourceful.,44
Piandao,"Excellent work, Sokka.",44
Piandao,I think I'm a little old to be fighting the Avatar.,44
Aang,How did you know‌?,44
Piandao,"Oh, I've been around a while. You pick things up. [  Wipes the dirt off his face with the cloth.  ] Of course, I knew from the beginning that Sokka was Water Tribe.

Katara,But why would you agree to train someone from the Water Tribe‌?,44
Piandao,"[  Close-up.  ] The way of the sword doesn't belong to any one nation.

Azula,"[  Close-up as she smiles. Side-view.  ] That's a sharp outfit, Chan. Careful. [  Close-up.  ] You could puncture the hull of an empire-class Fire Nation battleship, leaving  thousands  to drown at sea, [  Side-view. Points at Chan's outfit.  ] because it's so sharp.",45
Chan,[  Awkwardly.  ] Um ... thanks.,45
Ruon-Jian,"[  Casually.  ] Hey! First ones here, huh?",45
Zuko,"[  Side-view of Zuko and Mai walking.  ] He thinks he's so great. [  To Mai.  ] Well, what do you think of him?",45
Mai,I don't have any opinion about him. I hardly know him.,45
Zuko,"You like him, don't you? [  Mai sighs and walks away.  ]",45
Ember Island teenager #2,So how do you know Ty Lee?,45
Ember Island teenager #3,I met her at the beach today. She was pretty impressed by a sand pagoda that I made for her.,45
Ember Island teenager #1,"[  Camera zooms out slightly.  ] Well, I met her first.",45
Ty Lee,"[  Nervously.  ] Look, i-it doesn't matter who I met first, 'cause I like you all.",45
Ember Island teenager #2,[  Frontal view.  ] But which one of us do you  like  ?,45
Ember Island teenager #1,Yeah.,45
Ember Island teenager #3,Tell us.,45
Ty Lee,"[  Frontal view.  ] I don't know! I don't know! [  She kicks and punches out. Cut to behind the teens as they fall over after being chi-blocked. Ty Lee cartwheels over the teens. Side-view of Azula as Ty Lee approaches.  ] Oh, I'm glad you're here. Those boys won't leave me alone. I guess they all just like me too much.",45
Azula,"Come on, Ty Lee. You can't be this ignorant.",45
Ty Lee,[  Close-up.  ] What are you talking about?,45
Azula,"[  Frontal view over Ty Lee's shoulder.  ] Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them. You're not a challenge. You're a tease. It's not like they actually care who you are. [  Close-up of Ty Lee, who starts sobbing. Side-view of the two. Azula changes to a softer and gentler tone.  ] Okay, okay, calm down. I didn't mean what I said. [  Frontal view over Ty Lee's shoulder.  ] Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little ... [  Whispers.  ] jealous.",45
Ty Lee,"[  Frontal view over Azula's shoulder.  ] What? You're jealous of me? But you're the most beautiful, smartest, perfect girl in the world.",45
Azula,"[  Turns away.  ] Well, you're right about all those things. [  Cut to panning shot of the room.  ] But, for some reason, when I meet boys, they act as if I'm going to do something horrible to them.",45
Ty Lee,"[  Frontal view of Azula's shoulder. Giggling.  ] But you probably would do something horrible to them. I'm sure they're just intimidated by you. Okay, look, if you want a boy to like you, [  Close-up.  ] just look at him and smile a lot and laugh at everything he says even if it's not funny.",45
Azula,"[  Close-up.  ] Well, that sounds really shallow and stupid ... [  Turns to Ty Lee.  ] Let's try it.",45
Ty Lee,"[  Side-view.  ] Okay. [  Deep voice, imitating a boy.  ] Hey there, sweet sugar cakes. How you liking this party?",45
Mai,I'm bored.,45
Zuko,I know.,45
Mai,I'm hungry.,45
Zuko,So what?,45
Mai,"So, find me some food.",45
Zuko,Sure. [  Stands up and walks away.  ],45
Azula,"Chan, I'm ready for a tour of the house.",45
Chan,Is this your first time on Ember Island?,45
Azula,No. I used to come here years ago.,45
Chan,"[  Side-view.  ] It's a great place, if you like sand. [  Close-up of Azula, who laughs. Side-view.  ] Yeah, it's like, welcome to Sandy Land!",45
Azula,Your arms look  so  strong.,45
Chan,"Yeah, I know. [  He flexes his muscles and they kiss. Close-up of Chan after they kiss.  ] You're pretty.",45
Azula,"[  Close-up; softly.  ] Together, [  Camera zooms out as she steps back; her voice grows progressively louder.  ] you and I will be the strongest couple in the entire world! [  Creates blue fireballs in her hands.  ] We will  dominate  the Earth!",45
Chan,[  Shakes his head back to normal. Freaked out.  ] Uh ... I got to go.,45
Zuko,"[  Angered.  ] Hey, watch it! That food was for my cranky girlfriend!",45
Ruon-Jian,What are you doing?,45
Zuko,[  Close-up. Angrily.  ] Stop talking to my girlfriend!,45
Ruon-Jian,[  Side-view. Walks up to Zuko.  ] Relax. It's just a party.,45
Mai,"[  Angrily.  ] Zuko, what is wrong with you?",45
Zuko,What's wrong with  me  ?,45
Mai,[  Scolding.  ] Your temper is out of control. You blow up over every little thing. You're so impatient and hotheaded and angry!,45
Zuko,"[  Snapping back.  ] Well, at least I feel something, as opposed to you. [  Frontal view from behind Mai.  ] You have no passion for anything! You're just a big blah!",45
Mai,"[  Turns away from Zuko.  ] It's over, Zuko. We're done.",45
Chan,[  Frontal view. Runs up to Ruon-Jian.  ] Who broke my nana's vase? [  Ruon-Jian points at Zuko. Cut to frontal view of Zuko and Mai. Chan runs up to him; to Zuko now.  ] That's it! You're out of here!,45
Zuko,[  Close-up.  ] I was just leaving.,45
Ruon-Jian,"[  Frontal view as Zuko walks away.  ] Have fun by yourself,  loser boy  .",45
Chan,Nice  .,45
Toph,"Guys, you're all gonna think I'm crazy, but it feels like a metal man is coming.",45
Azula,I thought I'd find you here.,45
Zuko,[  Side-view.  ] Those summers we spent here seem so long ago. So much has changed.,45
Azula,Come down to the beach with me. Come on. This place is depressing.,45
Mai,[  Side-view. Hesitating at first.  ] Hey.,45
Zuko,[  View of both from behind. Turning to Mai.  ] Where's your new boyfriend? [  Side-view. Mai turns away. View from behind Mai as Zuko sits down next to her.  ] Are you cold? [  Mai slaps his hand when he tries to place it on her shoulder.  ],45
Ty Lee,I'm  freezing  .,45
Zuko,[  Side-view; smiling.  ] I'll make a fire. [  View from behind Zuko as the camera pans up to show the vacation house.  ] There's plenty of stuff to burn in  there  .,45
Sokka,This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?,45
Aang,[  Gets up.  ] We can't! Jump on Appa! I'll try to distract him!,45
Aang,I'm okay. [  Momo jumps on his shoulder.  ],45
Toph,"Well, that was random.",45
Katara,[  Sitting up and looking back.  ] I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are.,45
Ty Lee,What are you doing?,45
Zuko,[  Frontal view.  ] What does it look like I'm doing?,45
Ty Lee,"[  Close-up aerial view of Zuko standing next to the fire.  ] But, it's a painting of your family.",45
Zuko,[  The camera pans up to Zuko's face; angrily.  ] You think I care?,45
Ty Lee,[  Off-camera.  ] I think you do.,45
Zuko,"You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business? [  Walks away.  ]",45
Ty Lee,[  Close-up. Scoffs.  ] I know you.,45
Zuko,"[  Frontal view.  ] No, you don't. [  Close-up.  ] You're stuck in your little ""Ty Lee world"" where everything's great all the time.",45
Mai,"Zuko, [  Frontal view.  ] leave her alone.",45
Zuko,"[  Walks away. Frontal view of campsite. Imitating Ty Lee.  ] ""I'm so pretty. Look at me. I can walk on my hands. Whoo!"" [  Does a handstand. Frontal view of Ty Lee, upset. Close-up of Zuko, as he falls to the ground. Frontal view of Ty Lee, Zuko's face in the foreground.  ] Circus freak.",45
Ty Lee,"[  Side-view. Azula giggles. Ty Lee cries.  ] Yes, I'm a circus freak. Go ahead and laugh all you want. You want to know  why  I joined the circus?",45
Azula,Here we go.,45
Ty Lee,"[  Aerial view of camp site.  ] Do you have any idea what my home life was like? [  Frontal view.  ] Growing up with six sisters who look exactly like me? [  She stands.  ] It was like I didn't even have my own name. [  Side-view. Kneels down, crying.  ] I joined the circus [  Close-up side-view.  ] because I was scared of spending the rest of my life as part of a matched set. At least I'm different now. [  Frontal view, she lifts her head; angrily.  ] ""Circus freak"" is a compliment.",45
Mai,"[  Frontal view.  ] Guess that explains why you need ten boyfriends, too.",45
Ty Lee,"[  Frontal view over Mai's shoulder; balls her hands into fists and points them on her hips.  ] I'm sorry, what?",45
Mai,"[  Frontal view.  ] Attention issues. You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid, so you're trying to make up for it now.",45
Ty Lee,"[  Close-up.  ] Well, what's  your  excuse, Mai? You were an only child for fifteen years, but even with all that attention, your aura is this dingy, pasty, gray ...",45
Mai,[  Frontal view.  ] I don't believe in auras.,45
Zuko,"[  Camera pans right. Getting up.  ] Yeah, you do not believe in anything.",45
Mai,"[  Close-up; sarcastically.  ] Oh, well, I'm sorry I can't be as high-strung and crazy as the rest of you.",45
Zuko,"[  Aerial view of campsite. Walking up to the campfire.  ] I'm sorry, too. I wish you  would  be high-strung and crazy for once instead of keeping all your feeling bottled up inside. [  Frontal view.  ] She just called your aura dingy. Are you gonna take that?",45
Mai,"[  Aerial view of campsite. Leaning back.  ] What do you want from me? You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't. [  Close-up.  ] I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted ... as long as I behaved [  Cut to shot of the sky.  ] and sat still, and didn't speak unless spoken to. [  Close-up of Zuko.  ] My mother said I had to keep out of trouble. We had my dad's political career to think about.",45
Azula,"[  Side-view of campsite.  ] Well, that's it, then. [  Close-up.  ] You have a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them, you were shut down. That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself.",45
Mai,[  Frontal view.  ] You want me to express myself? [  Stands up and yells.  ] Leave me alone!,45
Zuko,"[  Side-view of campsite. Frontal view of Zuko.  ] I like it when you express yourself. [  Approaching, attempting to put a hand on her shoulder.  ]",45
Mai,[  Frontal view.  ] Don't touch me! I'm still mad at you. [  She sits.  ],45
Zuko,"[  Side-view of Mai.  ] My life hasn't been that easy either, Mai.",45
Mai,Whatever. That doesn't excuse the way you've been acting.,45
Ty Lee,"Calm down, you guys. [  Frontal view of her and Azula.  ] This much negative energy is bad for your skin. You'll totally break out.",45
Zuko,Bad skin? [  Frontal view.  ]  Normal  teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. [  Leaning forward.  ] My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my  face  ! [  Points to his scar.  ],45
Ty Lee,"[  Frontal view of Azula and Ty Lee from behind Zuko. Apologetically.  ] Sorry, Zuko, I ...",45
Zuko,"[  Turning around.  ] For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home now, my dad talks to me. Ha! He even thinks I'm a hero. [  Close-up of Azula, who smiles.  ] Everything should be perfect, right? [  Aerial view of campsite.  ] I should be happy now, but I'm not. [  Turning back to the others.  ] I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why!",45
Azula,"[  Frontal view.  ] There's a simple question you need to answer, then. Who are you angry at?",45
Zuko,[  Close-up.  ] No one. I'm just angry.,45
Mai,"[  Side-view of the three girls.  ] Yeah, who are you angry at, Zuko?",45
Zuko,[  Close-up.  ] Everyone. I don't know. [  Becoming frustrated.  ],45
Azula,[  Frontal view.  ] Is it Dad?,45
Zuko,"[  Close-up.  ] No, no.",45
Ty Lee,[  Frontal view.  ] Your uncle?,45
Azula,Me?,45
Zuko,"[  Close-up.  ] No, no, n-no, no!",45
Mai,[  Close-up.  ] Then who? Who are you angry at?,45
Azula,"[  Camera pans left, past Ty Lee, to Azula.  ] Answer the question, Zuko.",45
Ty Lee,[  Close-up.  ] Talk to us.,45
Mai,"[  Extreme close-up.  ] Come on, answer the question.",45
Azula,"Come on, answer it.",45
Zuko,[  Frontal view from behind the girls. Losing it now; furiously.  ] I'm angry at myself!,45
Azula,Why?,45
Zuko,[  Close-up.  ] Because I'm confused. Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.,45
Azula,You're pathetic.,45
Mai,[  View from behind Zuko.  ] I know one thing I care about. [  Walks up to Zuko. Frontal view.  ] I care about you. [  They kiss.  ],45
Azula,"[  Claps. Camera zooms out to show her as Mai and Zuko turn.  ] Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone.",45
Zuko,"[  Frontal view.  ] I guess you wouldn't understand, would you, Azula? [  He puts an arm around Mai.  ] Because you're just  so  perfect.",45
Azula,"[  Frontal view.  ] Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care. [  Gazes into the fire. Close-up view of the fire pit.  ] My own mother [  Close-up.  ] thought I was a monster. [  Close-up of Zuko and Mai. Close-up of Ty Lee. Side-view of campsite. After a momentary pause.  ] She was right, of course, but it still hurt.",45
Ty Lee,"What Lo and Li said came true. The beach did help us learn about ourselves. [  She picks up a rock and rubs it, smiling. Close-up.  ] I feel all smoothed. I'll always remember this.",45
Azula,[  Side-view of campsite. Standing up.  ] You know what would make this trip  really  memorable?,45
Azula,"[  Frontal view.  ] We've got some bad news, Chan.",45
Zuko,[  Camera zooms in quickly to Zuko. Turns to look at Chan.  ] Party's over.,45
Roku,"Aang, it's time you learn of my history with Fire Lord Sozin. [  Cut to a close-up of Aang's face in his dream, before cutting back to Roku.  ] You need to understand how the war began, if you want to know how to end it. [  Cut to an overhead shot of Roku's island.  ] Meet me on my home island on the day of the summer solstice.",46
Aang,"[  Talking in his sleep.  ] Okay, Roku.",46
Zuko,"[  Reading the scroll.  ] You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise. It will reveal your own destiny. [  He closes the scroll, and stares down the hallway.  ]",46
Aang,There it is. That's Roku's home.,46
Katara,"[  Confused.  ] But, there's nothing here.",46
Toph,"Yes, there is. An entire village, hundreds of houses ... [  A strong breeze moves a layer of ash along the ground, brushing past their feet.  ] all completely buried in ash.",46
Azula,"It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko. Make sure he gets your good side.",46
Zuko,"Wait, I need to ask you something. [  Azula stops walking.  ] What do you remember about our great-grandfather's history?",46
Azula,"[  She sighs.  ] Oh, Zuko, it's so strange how your mind works. [  Cut to an overhead shot of the hall, as Azula tells Zuko about Sozin's history.  ] Fire Lord Sozin began the war, of course. [  Cut to Fire Lord Sozin's portrait, as it pans from the bottom to the top.  ] He spent his early years secretly preparing for it. He was as patient as he was clever. He famously waited for the comet, later renamed Sozin's Comet, and used its power to launch his full-scale invasion of the world. [  Cut back to Zuko and Azula.  ] In the end, he died a very old and successful man.",46
Zuko,But how did he die?,46
Azula,"[  Turning toward Zuko.  ] Didn't you pay  any  attention in school, Zuko? He died peacefully, in his sleep. [  Cut to a shot of the full room, as Azula walks away.  ] He was ancient.",46
Zuko,What does it mean?,46
Zuko,[  Reading.  ] The Fire Sages keep the secret history in the Dragonbone Catacombs.,46
Zuko,[  Reading aloud.  ] The final testimony of Fire Lord Sozin.,46
Roku,"Come, Aang.",46
Aang,"[  He climbs on Fang, who flies off.  ] Where're we going?",46
Roku,"To visit my past. [  He smiles at Aang, as Aang grins widely.  ] Our shared past.",46
Sozin,"[  Narrating his history.  ] As I feel my own life dimming, I can't help but think of a time when everything was so much brighter.",46
Sozin,I remember my friend.,46
Sozin,"Looks like I win again, Roku. [  Extends a hand to help Roku to his feet.  ]",46
Roku,"Are you kidding? [  Takes Sozin's hands and gets up.  ] The tree root did all the work. [  After getting up, he pats Sozin on his shoulders.  ] Nice one, Sozin.",46
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] You were friends with Fire Lord Sozin‌?,46
Roku,"Back then, he was just  Prince  Sozin. [  Cut to a close-up of Roku's face.  ] And he was my best friend.",46
Sozin,[  Nudging Roku.  ] Say something to her.,46
Roku,Love is hard when you are young.,46
Aang,You don't have to tell me.,46
Roku,"[  Putting his hand over Aang's shoulder.  ] Don't worry, it gets better. [  He turns back and walks, along with Aang.  ] Now, come with me. [  Cut to a celebration on a courtyard.  ] We have a party to attend.",46
Aang,"Wait, whose party is it?",46
Roku,"[  Cut to the young Roku and Prince Sozin.  ] Sozin and I shared many things, including a birthday.",46
Sozin,Did something happen to my father?,46
Fire Sage,"No, Prince Sozin. We are not here for you. [  Shot cuts to the Fire Sage talking.  ] We're here to announce the identity of the next Avatar. [  The crowd whispers, as the shot cut to Roku and Sozin, both in shock. Cut again to a close-up of the Sages. The Sages bow to the new Avatar.  ] It is our honor to serve you, Avatar Roku.",46
Sozin,"Soon the day came when my friend Roku had to leave the Fire Nation and face his destiny as the Avatar. [  Cut to a close-up of Zuko's face, as he reads.  ] He needed to travel the world so he could master the other elements.",46
Sozin,"Hey, why aren't you packed yet, all-powerful Avatar?",46
Sozin,"[  Sozin leaps in the room, attempting to demonstrate examples of all the bending disciplines.  ] Come on, show me how it's done using all four kinds of bending.",46
Roku,"I started packing, but then the Fire Sages told me I won't need any worldly possessions anymore.",46
Sozin,Oh. [  He sits down near Roku.  ],46
Roku,It happened so fast. Everything's gonna be different now.,46
Sozin,"Here, hope you're at least allowed to have this. [  Shot cuts to a close-up of the headpiece.  ]",46
Roku,But this is a royal artifact. [  Cut to a shot of the friends from behind.  ] It's supposed to be worn by the Crown Prince.,46
Sozin,I want you to have it.,46
Katara,Do they have bathrooms in the Spirit World?,46
Sokka,"[  Raises his forefinger.  ] As a matter of fact, they do not.",46
Aang,"[  Excited.  ] Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple!",46
Roku,This was the first stop on my Avatar journey.,46
Roku,It was the place where I was trained to master airbending.,46
Roku,And also where I met an old friend of yours: Monk Gyatso.,46
Aang,No way!,46
Roku,"Hey, Gyatso, you wanna see a new glider trick? [  He flies up and loops twice.  ]",46
Gyatso,[  Laughing.  ] Check this out! [  He flips himself over and stands on top of his glider. Cut to Aang and Roku.  ],46
Aang,He's air surfing! I can't believe I never thought of that.,46
Aang,[  Smiling and surprised.  ] That's amazing! I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was!,46
Roku,"[  Camera pans back to show Roku.  ] Some friendships are so strong, [  He closes his eyes.  ] they can even transcend lifetimes.",46
Roku,"After my years mastering airbending, I traveled to the Northern Water Tribe.",46
Roku,"Waterbending was especially challenging for me. But in time, I mastered it as well.",46
Roku,I moved on to the Earth Kingdom.,46
Roku,"My earthbending master, Sud, was uncompromising, stubborn, and blunt ...",46
Roku,... And a lifelong friend.,46
Roku,"It was bitter work ... [  The camera pans back to Roku, as he moves his arms to bend the different elements.  ] but the results were worth it. [  He starts by waterbending, before moving on to earthbending, firebending, and finally, airbending. The camera zooms out to an aerial view of Roku at the center of the four elements.  ]",46
Sozin,"Twelve long years passed before I saw my friend again. When Roku returned, he was a fully realized Avatar, and I had changed as well.",46
Roku,"Sozin! Or should I say, Fire Lord!",46
Sozin,"[  Scene changes to Sozin from below him. Serious.  ] Customarily, my subjects bow before greeting me. [  He walks down from his throne.  ] But you're the exception. [  He smiles and hugs Roku.  ]",46
Roku,"After all these years, he was still my best friend. [  Scene changes to a wedding ceremony and celebration in a Fire Nation courtyard, with many guests attending. Cut to Roku, on whose right is Sozin, holding a scroll.  ] And a few months later, he was my best man.",46
Aang,"[  As Roku lifts the veil.  ] Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you're alive!",46
Roku,"Ta Min. I was persistent. [  She stands up near Roku.  ] When love is real, it finds a way. [  The attendees clap, as the newly-wed couple bow their heads. Cut to a shot of the couple from the side, as Aang and Roku watch.  ] And being the Avatar doesn't hurt your chances with the ladies, either.",46
Sozin,"On wedding days, we look to the future with optimism and joy. [  Fade to Sozin in deep thought.  ] I had my own vision for a brighter future.",46
Sozin,[  Leaning toward Ta Min.  ] Excuse me. May I borrow him for a moment‌?,46
Ta Min,"It's not very traditional, but, okay.",46
Roku,What's on your mind?,46
Sozin,[  Raises his fist slightly.  ] I've been thinking hard about the state of the world lately.,46
Roku,"[  Putting his arm over Sozin's shoulder.  ] Sozin, it is my wedding! Have a cookie, dance with someone, lighten up!",46
Sozin,"[  Smiling slightly.  ] I know, I know, but just hear me out. [  Roku bows in agreement. Cut to a shadowed side-shot of the balcony as they walk.  ] Right from the start, I was destined to be Fire Lord. And although we didn't always know it, you were destined to be the Avatar. [  Cut to a close-up side-shot of the two. Roku stops as Sozin continues on.  ] It's an amazing stroke of fate we know each other so well, isn't it? Together, we could do ...  anything  .",46
Roku,"[  The camera pans toward Roku. Now serious.  ] Yeah, we could.",46
Sozin,"[  Cut to a shot of the Fire Nation from the balcony.  ] Our nation is enjoying an unprecedented time of peace and wealth. Our people are happy, and we're so fortunate in so many ways.",46
Roku,[  Concerned.  ] Where are you going with this?,46
Sozin,"I've been thinking, we should share this prosperity with the rest of the world. [  Cut to a shocked Roku with the camera closing in on him.  ] In our hands is the most successful empire in history. [  Back to a close-up of Sozin.  ] It's time we expanded it.",46
Roku,No! The four nations are meant to be just that: four.,46
Sozin,"[  Cut to Sozin.  ] Roku, you haven't even stopped to consider the possibilities.",46
Roku,"[  Cut to a close-up side-shot of Roku.  ] There are no possibilities. This is the last I want to hear [  Closes his eyes.  ] about this. [  He walks away from the balcony, with an angry expression on his face.  ]",46
Roku,"[  His spirit speaks to Aang.  ] That was my first real test as the Avatar. Unfortunately, it was many years before I learned [  Cut to a extreme close-up of Sozin.  ] that Sozin [  Sozin narrows his eyes. Fade to a back-shot of Fang flying with Roku.  ] had gone ahead with his plan, despite my warning.",46
Roku,"[  Angry.  ] I've seen the colonies, Sozin. [  Points at Sozin.  ] How dare you occupy Earth Kingdom territory!",46
Sozin,"[  Cut to Sozin, as Roku walks up to him.  ] How dare you, a citizen of the Fire Nation, address your Fire Lord this way. [  Cut to a close-up of Sozin's face from the side.  ] Your loyalty is to our nation first. Anything less makes you a traitor.",46
Roku,"Don't do this, Sozin. Don't challenge me. It will only end badly. It's over.",46
Roku,"I'm sparing you, Sozin. [  Cut to a frontal shot of Roku.  ] I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship. But I warn you. [  Cut to a extreme close up of Roku.  ] Even a single step out of line will result in your  permanent  end.",46
Roku,"Sozin and I didn't speak or see each other for twenty-five years after our battle. [  Cut to Roku's house.  ] I spent most of my spare time here, at my home.",46
Roku,"Let's go! [  He catches his wife's hand, and airbends smoke and ash in their way, creating a path, as both run through the path he created.  ]",46
Sozin,Roku's island was a hundred miles away. But I could still feel it rumbling and see the black plume of smoke. I had never seen anything like this catastrophe.,46
Aang,"This is amazing, Roku! You're battling a volcano, and you're winning.",46
Roku,"Unfortunately, my success didn't last long, Aang. There was no way I could do it all.",46
Roku,"[  To Aang.  ] Battling the elements was hard enough. I had to do it while I could barely breathe. The poisonous, volcanic gases were overwhelming.",46
Roku,[  Airbends a jet of gases.  ] It's all right Fang! [  Coughs.  ] Get out of here! I'm fine!,46
Sozin,"Need a hand, old friend?",46
Roku,[  A surprised Roku turns back.  ] Sozin?,46
Sozin,There's not a moment to waste.,46
Roku,Don't breathe the toxic gas.,46
Roku,"[  Shaking, Cut to Roku's point of view. He lifts his hands to look at them, as they blur out of focus.  ] It's too much.",46
Roku,Please.,46
Sozin,"Without you, all my plans are suddenly possible. [  Cut to Roku.  ] I have a vision for the future, Roku.",46
Aang,"Who's ... wait, that's me, isn't it? [  Cut to a long shot of three Air Nomads. A nun holds up the baby to the light while two people, presumably the infant's parents, stand in the shadows.  ]",46
Roku,"Make sense of our past, Aang. [  Cut to Roku and Aang.  ] And you will bring peace, and restore balance in the world. [  He slowly disappears.  ]",46
Aang,Roku? Roku!,46
Sozin,"With Roku gone, and the great comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the world. [  Cut to Sozin, standing on a balcony, from the behind, looking at his soldiers and the Fire Navy ships.  ] I knew the next Avatar would be born an Air Nomad. So I wiped out the Air Temples. [  Scene changes to a burning temple. The camera slowly fades into an extreme close-up of Sozin's face.  ] But somehow, the new Avatar eluded me. [  Scene changes to Fire Navy ships searching in the polar regions.  ] I wasted the remainder of my life searching in vain. [  Cut to underside of the ship.  ] I know he's hiding out there somewhere. [  Camera pans below to show the iceberg Aang was trapped in.  ] The Fire Nation's greatest threat ... the last airbender.",46
Zuko,That can't be it! Where's the rest of it? [  He searches the scroll to find more information.  ],46
Zuko,"[  Angrily.  ] You sent this, didn't you? I found the secret history, which by the way should be renamed history most people already know! The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end.",46
Iroh,[  Looking up at Zuko.  ] No. He wasn't.,46
Zuko,[  Confused.  ] What are you talking about?,46
Iroh,"You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather. [  Cut to a bewildered Zuko.  ] Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.",46
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ] Why are you telling me this?,46
Iroh,"Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself. [  Zuko sits down, with his head facing down.  ] Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side. [  Zuko looks up.  ] What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by  you  . Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore  balance  to the world.",46
Iroh,This is a royal artifact. It's supposed to be worn [  Zuko stands.  ] by the Crown Prince.,46
Katara,"You mean, after all Roku and Sozin went through together, even after Roku showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that‌?",46
Toph,[  Cut to Toph.  ] It's like these people are born bad.,46
Aang,"[  Cut to Aang from the side, with Sokka standing near him.  ] No, that's wrong. I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all.",46
Sokka,[  Shrugging.  ] Then what  was  the point?,46
Aang,"[  Cut to Katara, Toph and Sokka from the behind, as Aang speaks.  ] Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. [  Cut to an aerial shot of the hardened lava wave.  ] Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. [  Shot cuts to a close-up of Aang's face.  ] And I also think it was about friendships.",46
Toph,"[  Camera pans to Toph, and cuts to a close-up of her face.  ] Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?",46
Aang,[  Catching Toph's hand.  ] I don't see why not.,46
Sokka,"Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ...",46
Katara,"[  Annoyed.  ] Oh, Sokka, just hold hands.",46
Toph,[  Angrily.  ] How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!,47
Katara,[  Crosses her arms.  ] You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. [  Turns away from Toph with her arms folded.  ],47
Aang,Okay. I'm ready for some training.,47
Toph,"Good job, Twinkle Toes. Visualize, then attack.",47
Katara,"Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph!",47
Toph,"What's the matter? Can't handle a little dirt, Madame Fussy-Britches?",47
Katara,"Oh, sorry. Did I splash you, Mud-Slug?",47
Aang,Are we taking a break?,47
Sokka,[  Screaming.  ] Sneak Attack!,47
Aang,"[  While raising his blindfold and turning to face Sokka.  ] Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud.",47
Toph,Hungry for a mud pie? [  Kicks mud in Katara's face.  ],47
Katara,[  Wiping mud off of her face.  ] I'll give you a mud pie!,47
Aang,"Uh guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me.",47
Katara,"[  Takes a few steps forward, covered in mud; calmly.  ] Very well, pupil. I believe we've had enough training for today. [  Turns and walks away.  ]",47
Toph,"While Katara cleans up, [  Earthbends the mud off of herself and runs toward Aang and Sokka.  ] let's go have some fun!",47
Aang,Yeah!,47
Sokka,[  Simultaneously with Aang.  ] Yes!,47
Sokka,"Look at all those messenger hawks! You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. I could just send them messages.",47
Toph,"I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you. [  Sokka glares at her.  ]",47
Aang,"[  While holding up a silver piece.  ] So, guys. What are we gonna get with our last silver piece?",47
Toph,[  Stops walking.  ] We can get more money. [  They both look back at her.  ] Right there. [  Points to an area beneath them. Aang and Sokka move back to look where she is pointing.  ],47
Toph,"This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage. Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute. But I can feel it with my earthbending. [  As she says this, the scam artist continues to move the shells around as the gambler tries to focus on the shell with the rock, and right before stopping, the scam artist quickly and inconspicuously earthbends the rock from underneath one of the shells into his sleeve.  ]",47
Dealer,[  To Toph.  ] You there. Wanna play a friendly game?,47
Toph,How can I possibly play? [  Waves her hand in front of her face.  ] I'm blind.,47
Dealer,You don't have to see to be lucky.,47
Aang,"Flamey-O, Toph.",47
Dealer,Wow. Fancy guessing. You are amazing at this. [  Plays with a few silver pieces in his hands.  ] Would you like to make the game a little more interesting?,47
Toph,[  Curiously.  ] More interesting? How?,47
Dealer,"[  Points at Sokka's sword.  ] Well, let's say you toss in your friend's fine sword there, [  Grabs a big bag of money.  ] then I'll put up twenty silver pieces against it, and that's more interesting.",47
Toph,[  Grabs Sokka's sword.  ] I'll do it for forty silver pieces. [  Sokka stares at them with his mouth wide open.  ],47
Dealer,"Forty silver pieces it is. [  Drops some more money into the bag and starts moving the shells, faster this time.  ]",47
Dealer,"[  Moves his hand over to the shell, about to lift it.  ] Sorry, little lady, but- [  Lifts up the shell and sees the rock, which shocks and confuses him.  ] Huh? [  Stares closely at the rock.  ]",47
Toph,"I won! [  She grabs the bag of money, and Sokka grabs his sword as they run off.  ]",47
Katara,Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff?,47
Aang,Toph got us money. [  Grabs an apple and takes a bite out of it as he sits down.  ] She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like. [  He mimics the scam artist moving the shells with his hand. Katara's expression shows disapproval.  ],47
Sokka,[  Sits down too.  ] She used earthbending to win the game! Classic!,47
Katara,"Ah, so she cheated.",47
Toph,"[  Starts to bite her apple, but stops to defend herself.  ] Hey! I only cheated because he was cheating! [  Smiles.  ] I cheated a cheater. [  Closes her eyes in confidence.  ] What's wrong with that?",47
Katara,I'm just saying this isn't something we should make a habit of doing.,47
Toph,Why? Because it's fun? And you hate fun?,47
Katara,"I don't hate fun! [  Places Momo on her head like a hat while grinning unconvincingly.  ] See? Fun! [  Momo slips off her head, screeches at her, and runs away.  ]",47
Aang,"[  Stands up.  ] Katara, [  Slightly lifts his headband to reveal his airbender tattoo and bows.  ] I'll personally make you an Avatar Promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams.",47
Katara,"Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough. If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen.",47
Toph,Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up? [  Tosses some money to Katara.  ],47
Katara,"[  Angrily.  ] Oh, I'm sorry! You think I should be more like you? Like some wild child? [  Tosses the money back at Toph.  ]",47
Toph,"Yeah! Maybe! Maybe then you'd see [  Sokka grabs the money off the ground.  ] how great we have it! I mean, look at us! [  Leans back on the rock behind her and crosses her arms behind her head.  ] We're traveling around the world! Making easy money! Having fun! With no parents to tell us what to do!",47
Katara,Ah. I see. You're acting like this because of your parents.,47
Toph,Whatever.,47
Katara,"They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist. You act like you hate them, but you don't. You just feel guilty.",47
Toph,I  do  hate them.,47
Katara,"I don't think so. I think you miss them, but you just don't wanna deal with that, so instead you act like this crazy person.",47
Toph,"[  Stands up; angrily.  ] Look, I ran away to help Aang!",47
Katara,"You know what? It doesn't matter. These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that. [  Points at her forehead.  ] We've already got some third-eyed freak after us.",47
Sokka,"Speaking of that ""third-eyed freak"", I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of ""Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man""? [  Silence.  ] Just think about it.",47
Katara,[  Angrily.  ] We have enough money! You need to stop this!,47
Toph,[  Angrily.  ] I'll stop when I wanna stop and not when you tell me! [  Uses earthbending to launch the bag of money behind her into her hand and walks away angrily. Katara shakes her head angrily as Toph sits and creates an earth tent.  ],47
Sokka,"[  Grabs his bag of money and his sword and stands up.  ] Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some. See you guys later. [  Walks away.  ]",47
Sokka,"Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any fighting. [  Scratches Hawky on the stomach.  ] Good little messenger hawky. Who's got pretty feathers? [  While walking away, he notices a wanted poster he had just past with Toph's picture on it. He gasps in horror and rips it off the wall. Hawky screeches.  ] You're right, Hawky. This is bad. [  Suddenly, the bird poops while standing on Sokka's arm.  ]",47
Sokka,"Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like. [  Pulls out the wanted poster and shows it to her.  ]",47
Toph,"Well it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper.",47
Sokka,It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you the Runaway.,47
Toph,"[  Happily.  ] A wanted poster! That's so great! ""The Runaway."" I love my new nickname. Is there a picture of me? Does it look good?",47
Sokka,"[  Looks a few times at both the wanted poster and Toph.  ] Well yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. [  Gets back on topic.  ] But, Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us.",47
Toph,Don't be such a worrywart like your sister. [  Stands up and walks up to Sokka.  ] Think of it this way: Now you've got plenty of money to help with the invasion plan. [  Holds up a bag of money and jiggles it in front of him.  ],47
Sokka,"[  Ponders for a moment.  ] Well, that is true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa. [  Looks at Appa, who is napping, but opens one eye upon hearing this.  ]",47
Toph,"[  Takes some money out of the bag and hands the money to him.  ] Here's a little extra, so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know what? [  Gives the entire bag to him.  ] Make it an atlas.",47
Sokka,[  While taking the bag.  ] I do like expensive atlases.,47
Toph,Of course you do. [  Grabs the wanted poster and tucks it into her outfit.  ] And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret. [  Walks away.  ],47
Katara,"Sokka, [  Places her hand on her face; annoyed.  ] tell me you didn't buy a bird.",47
Sokka,"Not just a bird, a messenger bird. Now we can send messages all over the world. Even to Gran Gran.",47
Aang,"[  Excited.  ] Wow, how does it work?",47
Sokka,"Hm. Uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky, [  Points away from himself.  ] Gran Gran, South Pole. [  Hawky shakes himself.  ] I think he gets it.",47
Sokka,Hawky! Make nice! Bad Hawky!,47
Katara,[  Sarcastically.  ] Well. Look who decided to join us. [  Stands up.  ] Where have you two been? Off scamming again?,47
Toph,"Yes, we were. [  Puts her bag down.  ]",47
Katara,[  Slides to the right to behind Toph.  ] And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?,47
Toph,"No, I don't.",47
Katara,Really?,47
Toph,Yes. Really.,47
Katara,[  Starts to pull something out.  ] Well then. What's this? [  Shows Toph her wanted poster.  ],47
Toph,"[  Annoyed.  ] I don't know! I mean, seriously! What is with you people? I'm  blind  ! [  Points at her eyes and pulls down her bottom eyelids to emphasize her words.  ]",47
Katara,"It's a wanted poster of you! ""The Runaway!"" Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this?",47
Toph,[  Angrily.  ] Where did you get that!?,47
Katara,It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is-,47
Toph,You went through my stuff! You had no right!,47
Katara,"Your stuff was messy and I was just straightening up, and I happened to stumble across it!",47
Toph,"That's a lie! [  Points at her.  ] You're lying, Katara!",47
Katara,"[  Cut to a surprised Katara who glares at Toph. Pushes Toph's pointing hand out of her face.  ] Fine! It's a lie! But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up! I knew you were hiding something and you were! [  Shows her the poster again, but Toph grabs it, tosses it and starts to walk past Katara.  ] Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!",47
Toph,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Oh really, Mom? Or what are you gonna do? Send me to my room?",47
Katara,I wish I could!,47
Toph,"Well you can't! Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom! [  Extends her arm at Aang and Sokka, who are sitting on a ledge.  ]",47
Katara,I never said I was!,47
Toph,"No, but you certainly act like it! You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not! You're just a regular kid like the rest of us! So stop acting like you can tell me what to do! I can do whatever I want!",47
Katara,"I don't act that way! [  Looks at Sokka, who jumps as she says his name.  ] Sokka, do I act motherly?",47
Sokka,[  Puts his hands up defensively.  ] Hey. I'm staying out of this one.,47
Katara,"[  Looks at Aang.  ] What do you think, Aang? Do I act like a mom?",47
Aang,"[  Rubs his eye.  ] Well. I, uh-",47
Katara,[  Slightly annoyed.  ] Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!,47
Aang,"[  He and Sokka sit straight.  ] Yes, ma'am.",47
Toph,I can't be around you right now!,47
Katara,"Well, I can't be around you!",47
Sokka,"[  Rests his head in his hands.  ] I know, Hawky. Why can't they just get along?",47
Sokka,"Hey, Aang. You wanna test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea.",47
Aang,Sure. [  Leans his head closer to Sokka.  ],47
Sokka,"[  Talks into Aang's ear.  ] I'm going to send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again.",47
Aang,"I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas.",47
Sokka,"It's a gift. [  Pulls out a pen and ink and a piece of paper and starts to write.  ] ""Dear Katara, sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph.""",47
Katara,"I know this is from you, Sokka! Toph can't write! [  Tears the note up into pieces.  ] Ugh! You're all driving me crazy! [  Turns and walks away.  ]",47
Aang,I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.,47
Sokka,Yup. We're idiots. [  Hawky flies back onto his arm.  ],47
Aang,I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.,47
Sokka,"I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. [  Hawky screeches.  ] Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help. [  Walks to Toph.  ] Come on. We need to talk.",47
Toph,So lemme guess: You brought me out here to tell me that your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.,47
Sokka,"Nah, she's pretty much a pain. [  Katara, looking up at their feet from below and behind, glares and looks away.  ] She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ...",47
Toph,Yeah. I don't know how you could deal with it.,47
Sokka,"Actually, in a way, I rely on it. [  Katara looks back up at them.  ]",47
Toph,I don't understand.,47
Sokka,"When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.",47
Toph,I guess I never thought about that.,47
Sokka,"I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly? I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture. [  Katara, touched by what Sokka says, is reduced to tears.  ]",47
Toph,"The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. [  Wipes away tears from her left eye.  ] You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom. [  Katara, deeply touched by Toph's words, sinks slightly into the water. Toph punches Sokka in the arm.  ] Don't ever tell her I said any of this!",47
Sokka,"Hey, my lips are sealed.",47
Katara,"Hi, Toph. Um, I wanna-",47
Toph,"[  Holds up her hand in a ""stop"" fashion.  ] Katara, stop. You don't need to apologize. I was the one being stupid. These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them.",47
Katara,"[  Smiles.  ] Actually I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say ... I wanna pull a scam with you. [  Aang and Sokka stare at her from behind, extremely shocked.  ]",47
Toph,[  Also shocked.  ] What?  You  wanna pull a scam?,47
Katara,"Not just any scam. The  ultimate  scam. [  Sokka and Aang, still staring at her with shock, look at each other and faint, foaming from the mouth slightly. Katara puts her arm around Toph's shoulder, who gives a sly smile.  ] Whaddaya say, Toph? Just me and you. One last go. You in?",47
Toph,"[  Excited.  ] You  know  I'm in! Now what's this idea of yours? [  They walk away and leave Aang and Sokka behind, who are now unconscious and foaming at the mouth.  ]",47
Katara,"The plan is simple: This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money; Ten times more than you've made in all of your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way. [  As she speaks, the screen fades to the beginning of the episode, where Toph is seen running from the authorities and is caught in a net.  ]",47
Toph,[  Angrily.  ] How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!,47
Katara,[  Crosses her arms.  ] You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. [  Turns away from Toph.  ],47
Town authority,You did the right thing by turning in the Runaway.,47
Katara,The right thing is its own reward.,47
Town authority,"Well, I'm happy to hear you say that.",47
Katara,"[  Pauses for a moment.  ] But, I still want the actual reward.",47
Town authority,Of course. Right this way.,47
Toph,Hey! What kind of cell is this?,47
Female guard,A wooden one. [  She walks away as Toph becomes visibly worried.  ],47
Town authority,That's her! That's the girl you were looking for!,47
Aang,Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?,47
Sokka,"I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out. [  To Hawky and Momo.  ] You two behave. [  Pointing at Appa.  ] Appa's in charge. [  Appa lifts his head as the two animals start screeching at each other as soon as Sokka and Aang leave, but stop as soon as Appa roars at them.  ]",47
Toph,Wait! It's a trap!,47
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Really? No kidding! Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?",47
Toph,"Not for us, Katara! We're the bait! He wants Aang! [  Katara's eyes widen with realization.  ]",47
Katara,I can't believe I'm so stupid! See? This is exactly why I'm against these scams! I knew this would happen!,47
Toph,"But, this was  your  idea.",47
Katara,I know. I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.,47
Toph,"Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with.",47
Katara,I know your relationship with your parents is complicated. And I shouldn't have said what I said.,47
Toph,"It's okay. I was really mad when you said that because ... well because, maybe it's true. [  Starts to cry.  ] I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them.",47
Sokka,Where do you think they might be?,47
Aang,"Where do you think anyone is? [  The assassin is seen walking across a rooftop behind them. Aang hears him inhaling and becomes shocked when he turns and sees him.  ] Sokka, watch out! [  He grabs Sokka as they dodge a blast from the assassin and take cover behind an Ozai statue.  ] It's Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man!",47
Sokka,"You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit.",47
Katara,What are we gonna do?,47
Toph,I don't know. I wish we had some earth or water. We need bendables.,47
Katara,What about your meteor bracelet? You can make a saw.,47
Toph,I left it back at camp. [  Sits down.  ] I was worried they would take it.,47
Toph,"[  Confused.  ] Um, Katara? Are you okay?",47
Katara,Just fine.,47
Toph,"[  Still confused.  ] Well, what are you doing?",47
Katara,I'm making my own water.,47
Toph,"[  Amazed.  ] Katara! You're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius!",47
Sokka,This guy is too good! He shoots fire from his brain!,47
Aang,We should split up. He can't chase us both.,47
Katara,"Aang, get up! [  She helps him up and they run away.  ]",47
Toph,Let's get out of here!,47
Sokka,"[  Still running.  ] Hey, I got it! The perfect name for that guy: ""Combustion Man!""",47
Toph,"Good job, Sokka. Now let's get outta here before Combustion Man catches us.",47
Sokka,See? It fits so well!,47
Sokka,"[  Yawns.  ] Well, I'm exhausted. Hawky, how about you, buddy? [  Hawky makes a bird call.  ] Yeah. You're such a lazy little bird.",47
Toph,Katara? I need your help.,47
Katara,"[  Sits back down.  ] What is it, Toph?",47
Toph,[  Pulls out a sheet of paper.  ] I need you to write some things down for me. I wanna send a letter to my parents.,47
Katara,[  Smiling.  ] I'll be happy to help.,47
Sokka,"Hey, where'd Hawky go?",47
Avatar Roku,[  Narrating a preview.  ] Previously on Avatar ...,48
Katara,You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole. This ship has haunted my tribe when Gran-Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.,48
Yue,"The legend said the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestor saw how it pushed and pulled the tides, and learned how to do it themselves.",48
Katara,I always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.,48
Toph,What are you doing?,48
Katara,I'm making my own water!,48
Sokka,"[  Telling a ghost story.  ] Suddenly, they heard something down the hall in the dark. Oooh ... It came into the torchlight ... and they knew the blade of Wing Fung was haunted! [  Draws sword, stands up and points it toward the fire; yells dramatically.  ] Ooh-aaah!",48
Aang,"[  Unimpressed.  ] I think I like ""the man with a sword for a hand"" better.",48
Toph,Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.,48
Katara,"No, wait! I've got one! And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story.",48
Sokka,"[  Sitting down.  ] Is this one of those ""a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to"" stories?",48
Katara,"No, it happened to Mom.",48
Katara,"One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home. [  Cuts to ground-level shot of the group sitting around the fire, the camera panning slightly to the right.  ] Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice. [  In a scary voice.  ] ""It's so cold and I can't get warm!"" [  Sokka stiffens in fear.  ] Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone.",48
Sokka,[  Peering from behind a tree trunk.  ] Where'd she go?,48
Katara,"No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.",48
Toph,"[  Gasping.  ] Wait! Guys, did you hear that? [  Aang, Katara, and Sokka clutch each other tightly, too stiff to move, with Toph standing alertly.  ] I hear people under the mountain. And they're screaming.",48
Sokka,Pfft! Nice try.,48
Toph,"[  Cuts to shot of the campsite viewed through the ominous-looking tree branches.  ] No, I'm serious. I hear something.",48
Katara,You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories ...,48
Toph,It just ... stopped.,48
Aang,"[  Cuts back to him and Katara, still hugging, Sokka sitting close by.  ] All right, now I'm getting scared.",48
Hama,"[  Off-camera from behind group.  ] Hello, children.",48
Hama,Sorry to frighten you. My name is Hama. [  Cuts to side-view of the campsite.  ] You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at night. [  Cuts to ground-level shot of Hama standing over the fire.  ] I have an inn nearby. Why don't you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds?,48
Sokka,"[  Sheepishly, places arm behind head.  ] Yes, please.",48
Katara,Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn.,48
Hama,[  Sets teapot down.  ] Aren't you sweet? [  Walks over to her seat and sits down.  ] You know you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in.,48
Sokka,"What do you mean ""disappearing""?",48
Hama,"[  Sets her teacup down.  ] When the moon turns full, people walk in and they don't come out. [  Stand up and holds up her teapot; cheerfully smiling.  ] Who wants more tea?",48
Hama,"Don't worry, you'll all be completely safe here. [  Clasps hands together and smiles.  ] Why don't I show you to your rooms and you can get a good night's rest?",48
Sokka,"I know, Momo. [  Places sword back inside holster and sets it down.  ] This place is creepy! [  Lies back down on the pillow and pulls the covers over him.  ] I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep!",48
Hama,"[  Off-camera.  ] Wakey, wakey! [  Cuts to shot of the innkeeper, standing brightly over him.  ] Time to go shopping!",48
Katara,That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages?,48
Hama,[  Seriously.  ] You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man? [  Cheerfully.  ] I think you and I are going to get along swimmingly!,48
Villager,You won't have any ash bananas till next week?,48
Shop owner,"Well, I have to send the boy to Hing Wa Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip.",48
Villager,"Oh, right. Tomorrow's the full moon.",48
Shop owner,[  In a lowered voice.  ] Exactly. I can't lose  another  delivery boy in the woods.,48
Sokka,"People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff happening during full moons? This just reeks of Spirit World shenanigans.",48
Aang,"I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad.",48
Sokka,"[  Makes gesture with his hand.  ] And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style!",48
Aang,[  Proudly.  ] Helping people ... that's what I do.,48
Hama,Why don't you take all those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while.,48
Sokka,[  Walks up to her.  ] This is a mysterious little town you have here.,48
Hama,[  Extremely close-up. Ominously.  ] Mysterious town for mysterious children.,48
Sokka,"That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.",48
Katara,[  Unpacking items.  ] That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. [  Picks up cabbage.  ] She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran.,48
Sokka,"But what did she mean by that comment, ""mysterious children""?",48
Katara,"Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?",48
Sokka,I'm gonna take a look around. [  Walks away and up a flight of wooden stairs.  ],48
Katara,"[  Appears along with the others at the bottom of the stairwell.  ] Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? [  Off-camera as Sokka peers around the inn.  ] You can't just snoop around someone's house.",48
Sokka,It'll be fine.,48
Aang,[  Off-camera while Sokka peers into a room.  ] She could be home any minute.,48
Katara,"[  Walking down hallway with the rest of the team.  ] Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!",48
Sokka,"[  Tugging on a cupboard door.  ] I'm not finished yet. [  Grunts, as he tries to pull it free.  ] Come on ...",48
Aang,"Okay, that's pretty creepy.",48
Katara,"[  Walks over and closes the cupboard; a bit weirded out.  ] So she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. [  Angrily.  ] Sokka, you've looked enough. [  Off-camera as Sokka ascends into the attic.  ] Hama will be back soon.",48
Sokka,"Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Well then why does she have a locked door up here?",48
Katara,[  Annoyed.  ] Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!,48
Sokka,"We'll see. [  Peers through the keyhole into the room. Cuts to shot of the attic from his perspective. Through the keyhole, a small room can be seen, with a chest lying on the ground in the middle. The camera zooms in on the chest.  ] It's empty, except for a little chest.",48
Toph,Maybe it's treasure!,48
Katara,"[  Approaches him.  ] Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room!",48
Sokka,I have to see what's in there.,48
Aang,We shouldn't be doing this.,48
Sokka,Maybe there's a key here somewhere ...,48
Toph,Ooh! Hand it over!,48
Sokka,"[  Eagerly.  ] Come on, come on!",48
Toph,"[  Annoyed; Katara appears from behind her, peering nervously over her shoulder.  ] This isn't as easy as it looks!",48
Aang,"[  Nervously.  ] Guys, I don't know about this ...",48
Katara,This is crazy! I'm leaving!,48
Sokka,"Suit yourself! Do it, Toph!",48
Hama,[  Off-camera from behind them.  ] I'll tell you what's in the box.,48
Sokka,[  Surprised.  ] An old comb?,48
Hama,It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I own from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe.,48
Katara,[  Stunned.  ] You're from the Southern Water Tribe?,48
Hama,[  Sets down comb.  ] Just like you.,48
Katara,How did you know?,48
Hama,I heard you talking around your campfire.,48
Sokka,But why didn't you tell us?,48
Hama,"I wanted to surprise you! I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes if you stew them long enough.",48
Aang,[  Sticking his tongue out in disgust.  ] Great ...,48
Katara,I knew I felt a bond with you right away.,48
Sokka,"And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right. [  Grimaces as Katara hits him in the arm.  ] But I'm sorry we were sneaking around.",48
Hama,"Apology accepted. [  Turns to the side and motions with her hand.  ] Now, let's get cooking!",48
Aang,[  Whispering to Toph.  ] I'd steer clear of the sea prunes.,48
Toph,I thought they were ocean kumquats.,48
Aang,Close enough.,48
Hama,Who wants five flavor soup?,48
Katara,[  Delighted.  ] You're a waterbender! [  Faces Hama in delight.  ] I've never met another waterbender from our tribe!,48
Hama,[  Cuts to side-view of her; sadly.  ] That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one ...,48
Sokka,So how did you end up out here?,48
Hama,[  Grimly.  ] I was stolen from my home.,48
Hama,[  Voice-over.  ] It was over sixty years ago when the raids started.,48
Hama,"[  Voice-over.  ] They came again and again, each time rounding up more of our waterbenders and taking them captive.",48
Hama,"[  Voice-over.  ] We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued.",48
Hama,"[  Voice-over.  ] Finally, I too was captured.",48
Hama,[  Voice-over.  ] I was led away in chains. The last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe.,48
Hama,They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape.,48
Sokka,How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?,48
Hama,I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore.,48
Katara,We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid.,48
Hama,"[  Sympathetically.  ] Oh, you poor things.",48
Katara,I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor. You're a hero.,48
Hama,I never thought I'd meet another Southern waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know so you can carry on the Southern tradition when I'm gone.,48
Katara,"Yes! Yes, of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me.",48
Hama,"Growing up in the South Pole, waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas. But as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go.",48
Katara,"I know! When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do.",48
Hama,[  Stops walking.  ] That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists.,48
Katara,I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.,48
Hama,"[  Smiling.  ] That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you could even pull water out of thin air?",48
Hama,"You have got to keep an open mind, Katara. [  The water around her fingertips freezes, creating ice claws.  ] There's water in places you never think about.",48
Aang,This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.,48
Toph,Maybe the Moon Spirit just turned mean.,48
Sokka,"[  Angrily.  ] The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!",48
Aang,"[  Catches sight of a villager walking past.  ] Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?",48
Villager,Only one man ever saw it and lived and that's Old Man Ding.,48
Toph,Where does Old Man Ding live?,48
Katara,"Wow, these flowers are beautiful.",48
Hama,"They're called fire lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants and all living things, they're filled with water.",48
Katara,I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside.,48
Hama,You can take it even further.,48
Katara,"That was incredible! [  Sees the wilted lilies.  ] It's a shame about the lilies, though.",48
Hama,"They're just flowers. When you're a waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight I'll teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak.",48
Katara,[  Cautiously.  ] But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.,48
Hama,"Oh, Katara. Two master waterbenders beneath a full moon? [  Begins walking away.  ] I don't think we have anything to worry about.",48
Aang,Old Man Ding?,48
Ding,"Huh? [  Accidentally hammers his thumb.  ] Ow, dang blame it! What? Can't you see I'm busy? Got a full moon rising. And why does everyone call me that? I'm not that old! [  Attempts to lift a wooden plank off the ground, but fails to do so. Sighs.  ] Well, I'm young at heart.",48
Ding,Not ready to get snapped up by some moon monster yet at least.,48
Sokka,[  Proceeds to nail the board to the window frame.  ] We wanted to ask you about that.,48
Aang,Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?,48
Ding,"Didn't see no spirit, just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain. [  Points to the mountain.  ] I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my own limbs. It just about had me into a cave up there. [  Imitates a walking puppet.  ] And I looked up at the moon for what I thought would be my last glimpse of light. [  Cuts to shot of the trio, Sokka quivering in fear.  ] But then the sun started to rise and I got control of myself again! I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could!",48
Sokka,Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?,48
Toph,Oh no! [  Sokka and Aang assume defensive positions.  ] I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there!,48
Toph,[  Feels the ground with her hand.  ] I can hear them. They're this way!,48
Hama,Can you feel the power the full moon brings?,48
Hama,"For generations it has blessed waterbenders with its glow, allowing us to do incredible things!",48
Hama,[  Extreme close-up; in a sinister tone.  ] I've never felt more alive.,48
Toph,This is the place.,48
Sokka,I can't see anything down there.,48
Toph,[  Grabs Sokka's hand.  ] That's why you have me. Let's go!,48
Male prisoner #1,We're saved!,48
Aang,I didn't know spirits made prisons like this. Who brought you here?,48
Female prisoner,It was no spirit.,48
Male prisoner #2,It was a witch!,48
Sokka,A witch? What do you mean?,48
Female prisoner,"[  Speaking, as Toph unlocks her shackles.  ] She seems like a normal old woman, but she controls people like some dark puppetmaster!",48
Sokka,[  Gritting.  ] Hama!,48
Male prisoner #1,"Yes, the innkeeper!",48
Sokka,I knew there was something creepy about her!,48
Aang,We have to stop Hama!,48
Toph,I'll get these people out of here. You go!,48
Hama,"What I'm about to show you, [  Cuts to close-up of Hama glaring menacingly.  ] I discovered in that wretched Fire Nation prison.",48
Hama,"[  Voice-over.  ] The guards were always very careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air and had us suspended away from the ground. Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend. [  A side-view is shown of Fire Nation guards giving water to a tied up prisoner.  ] Any sign of trouble was met with  cruel  retribution. [  Cuts to shot of the full moon in the sky during present day.  ] And yet each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. [  Cuts to shot of Hama.  ] There had to be something I could do to escape. [  Scene fades to flashback of the prison.  ] Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. [  A younger Hama is shown bending the water inside an elephant rat that had wandered its way into her cage.  ] The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing more than skins filled with liquid and I passed years developing the skill that would lead to my escape. [  A close-up is shown of Hama smiling at her discovery. The scene fades back to present day. Ominously.  ] Bloodbending. [  Cut to a scared Katara.  ] Controlling the water in another body, [  Cut to ground shot of both Hama and Katara.  ] enforcing your own will over theirs. [  The scene fades back to a flashback of young Hama controlling a horde of rats using bloodbending.  ] Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men.",48
Hama,"[  Voice-over.  ] And during the next full moon, I walked free for the first time in decades. [  The guard attempts to get up, but Hama quickly forces him back down to the ground. She walks unsteadily away.  ] My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in. [  Scene changes back to present day; camera focuses on a close-up of Hama.  ] Once you perfect this technique, you can control anything or [  Looks at Katara from the corner of her eyes sadistically.  ] anyone.",48
Katara,[  Unsure.  ] But ... to reach inside someone and control them? [  Casts unsure glance off to the side.  ] I don't know if I want that kind of power.,48
Hama,"[  Camera zooms out to the two standing in the forest.  ] The choice is not yours. The power exists. And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. [  Closes up to Hama.  ] Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture, your mother!",48
Katara,[  Close-up of her face.  ] I know.,48
Hama,"[  Camera changes back to Hama.  ] Then you should understand what I'm talking about! We're the last two waterbenders of the Southern Tribe. [  Camera focuses on Katara; off-camera.  ] We have to fight these people whenever we can, wherever they are, with any means necessary!",48
Katara,[  Widens eyes in realization.  ] It's you ... [  Angrily.  ] You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!,48
Hama,"[  Close-up of her face, as she tilts her head downward.  ] They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters! They deserve the same! You must carry on my work!",48
Katara,"[  Points to Hama, stretching out her left hand.  ] I won't! I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town! [  Her hand suddenly twists to one side. She tries desperately to stop it, but fails to do so.  ]",48
Hama,"[  Now using bloodbending to subdue to her.  ] You should've learned the technique before you turned against me! [  Forces Katara into a strained position.  ] It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip! I control every muscle, every vein in your body!",48
Katara,[  Tearfully.  ] Stop! Please ...,48
Katara,"[  Determined.  ] You're not the only one who draws power from the moon! [  Assumes a fighting stance.  ] My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!",48
Hama,[  Shouts.  ] Aahhh!,48
Sokka,"We know what you've been doing, Hama!",48
Aang,Give up! [  Takes a fighting stance.  ] You're outnumbered!,48
Hama,No! [  Rising.  ] You've outnumbered yourselves.,48
Sokka,"[  Unwillingly draws his sword.  ] Katara, look out! [  Forced to walk like a puppet, while waving the blade back and forth rapidly.  ] It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it!",48
Aang,This feels weird!,48
Katara,"[  Using waterbending to freeze him to a nearby tree.  ] I'm sorry, Aang!",48
Aang,It's okay!,48
Hama,"[  Sinisterly.  ] Don't hurt your friends, Katara! And don't let them hurt each other!",48
Katara,[  Horrified.  ] No!,48
Male prisoner #1,You're going to be locked away forever.,48
Hama,"My work is done. [  Turns to Katara.  ] Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender.",48
Sokka,[  Somewhat excitedly.  ] This is it! The official rendezvous point for the invasion force.,49
Toph,How did you pick this place?,49
Sokka,"Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map. It's uninhabited, and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place.",49
Katara,"Nice choice, Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule.",49
Aang,[  Anxiously.  ] Wait! Four days? The invasion's in  four  days?,49
Sokka,[  Yawns.  ] Whatever. That's like four days from now. Let's just calm down and-,49
Katara,"Sokka's got the right idea, Aang. We're here. We're ready. The best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest. [  Lies down.  ]",49
Aang,[  Half-heartedly.  ] I guess.,49
Aang,"[  He makes some fast and dramatic ninja-like moves as he speaks.  ] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord! I'm bringing you down.",49
Ozai,Really? [  Brings his face close to Aang.  ] How do you plan on doing that when you're not even wearing pants?,49
Aang,Oh no!,49
Aang,"It was just a dream, Momo. I still have my pants. [  Stands up.  ] Well, I better keep training.",49
Servant #1,"Fresh fruit, Prince Zuko?",49
Servant #2,"May I wash your feet, sir?",49
Servant #1,Head massage?,49
Servant #2,Hot towel?,49
Servant #1,"Prince Zuko, is something wrong? You didn't take the palanquin.",49
Zuko,I'm just going to Mai's house. It's not far.,49
Servant #1,"It's not a prince's place to walk anywhere, sir.",49
Katara,Hey. How long have you been up?,49
Aang,A couple hours. I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai.,49
Katara,"[  Aang stops, panting.  ] You know, there is such a thing as over-training.",49
Aang,"You don't get it, do you? My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any firebending. Not even the basics.",49
Sokka,"That's okay, Aang. The eclipse will block off firebending anyway. You don't need to know it. [  Looking at Aang.  ] Plus, it's a stupid element.",49
Aang,"Okay, well I still have to work on everything else. I better spend the whole day training.",49
Aang,"[  Wide shot of the group on the cliffside with the camera slowly zooming out.  ] Good night, Katara. Good night, Sokka. Good night, Toph. Good night, Appa. Good night, Momo. Good night, Appa and Mo-",49
Toph,[  With chibi face in a speech bubble that appears above her; angrily.  ]  Go to sleep already!  [  Clenches her teeth.  ],49
Aang,"[  Frontal shot as he points outward.  ] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord. [  Scowls.  ] I'm bringing you down! [  Looks down momentarily; confidently.  ] And this time, I brought pants.",49
Ozai,"So it seems, but are you prepared for your ... mathematics test?",49
Aang,Math test? Oh no! I forgot all about the math test!,49
Aang,I've gotta be ready.,49
Katara,"Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep.",49
Aang,But I forgot my pants and my math test.,49
Katara,"Aang, sleep. Please. For me.",49
Zuko,"Tell me, if you could have anything you want right now, what would it be?",49
Mai,"Hm ... A big fancy fruit tart, with rose petals on top.",49
Zuko,"You know, being a prince and all, I  might  just be able to make that happen.",49
Mai,[  Chuckles.  ] That would be impressive.,49
Zuko,"[  To the servants.  ] Do you think you could find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top?",49
Servant,"Excellent choice, sir.",49
Mai,"I guess there's some nice perks that come with being royalty. [  Pushing him Zuko to lay down with her.  ] Though there's annoying stuff, too. Like that all-day war meeting coming up.",49
Zuko,"[  Sitting up, followed by Mai.  ] War meeting? What are you talking about?",49
Mai,"Azula mentioned something. I-I assumed you were going, too.",49
Zuko,I guess I wasn't invited.,49
Ozai,"Wake up, Aang. Wake up, sleepy head! [  Cut to an out of focus swaying shot of the Fire Lord standing over Aang.  ] Rise and shine! You overslept. [  The Fire Lord bends in close and then even closer.  ] You missed the invasion.",49
Aang,"Sokka, get up! I needa know what day it is!",49
Sokka,What? Who's talking?,49
Toph,Relax! It's still two days before the invasion!,49
Aang,"Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises.",49
Sokka,What?,49
Aang,"In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, [  Camera turns to show an annoyed look on Sokka's face.  ] but you were too slow and they got you!",49
Sokka,But that was just a dream. I'm a great climber!,49
Aang,[  While pointing at the cliff nearby.  ] Then climb that cliff! Climb it fast!,49
Sokka,Stupid Avatar! Stupid cliff! Stupid dream! I can climb fast!,49
Aang,[  Turning around to her.  ] Don't drink that!,49
Toph,Why? Is it poisoned?,49
Aang,"In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom! [  He puts his hands between his legs and squeezes them together.  ] We died because of your tiny bladder. [  He turns to Katara.  ] And you need to start wearing your hair up. In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and-.",49
Katara,"[  Putting a hand on the side of his face.  ] Aang! I know you're just trying to help, but you  really  need to get a grip. You're unraveling.",49
Aang,[  He takes a deep breath before finally speaking.  ] You're right. I'm losing my mind.,49
Aang,"It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed. I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves.",49
Sokka,"[  Turning to look at Aang.  ] Of course you are. That's 'cause you gotta fight the Fire Lord, the baddest man on the planet. And you better win or we're all done for.",49
Katara,"[  Approaching Sokka, annoyed.  ] Sokka! You're not helping!",49
Sokka,[  Standing.  ] What? It's true. That's the deal. He knows it.,49
Katara,"You know what, I've got just the thing! Get ready to be de-stressified!",49
Katara,"These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach  up  . [  Katara puts her hands above her head together, Aang follows along.  ] Reach for the sun. [  They wave their hands and upper bodies side to side.  ] Feel your chi paths clearing. [  Both bend over so their heads touch the ground, grabbing their legs.  ] Now close your eyes. How are you feeling?",49
Aang,[  Close-up of Aang sweating.  ] I feel ... really warm.,49
Katara,"Good, good. Go on.",49
Aang,Like there's this warm feeling all around me. This heat. [  Becoming frantic again.  ] Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me! And the whole world is being engulfed in flames!,49
Katara,Maybe your stress is the kind you need to  talk  out.,49
Sokka,[  In his Wang Fire voice.  ] Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.,49
Aang,You  know  what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.,49
Sokka,"[  He nods upon hearing Aang's explanation.  ] Tell me more about this ""Fire Lord"". Why are you so afraid of him?",49
Aang,You said it yourself! He's the baddest man on the planet! I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world!,49
Sokka,"[  Nodding in agreement.  ] Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it? Like we're all trying to save the world from evil.",49
Aang,Okay! But what can I do to feel better?,49
Sokka,[  While handing Aang a koala sheep.  ] Want to try screaming into this pillow?,49
Azula,"Hello, Zuzu. If you've come for a royal hair-combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait.",49
Zuko,"So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh? And apparently I'm not welcome there.",49
Azula,What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there!,49
Zuko,"Oh, yeah?! I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it!",49
Azula,"Oh, Zuko. Don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably just weren't invited because it's so  obvious  you're supposed to be there.",49
Zuko,"Well, were you invited?",49
Azula,Of course! I'm the princess.,49
Zuko,And I'm the prince!,49
Azula,"Exactly, so stop acting like a paranoid child! Just go to the meeting.",49
Zuko,Forget it! I'm not going!,49
Toph,All right! What you need is a good old-fashioned back pounding to relieve your stress.,49
Aang,[  Looking up at her.  ] Pound away.,49
Aang,[  The pillars causing him pain.  ] Ow! Toph ... I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me!,49
Toph,"Sorry. I forgot you had baby skin. [  Aang grabs onto the edge of the pillars and gets up.  ] Well, there's one other thing we can try. [  She stomps the ground, sending a distant boar-q-pine to her. She catches it and holds it out to Aang with a wide grin.  ] Acupuncture!",49
Mai,"Zuko, it's just a dumb meeting. Who cares?",49
Zuko,I don't.,49
Mai,"Well, good. You shouldn't. I mean, why would you even  want  to go? Just think about how things went the last meeting you went to.",49
Zuko,[  Sighs.  ] I know.,49
Mai,You know what will make you feel better? [  Zuko turns his head slightly.  ] Ordering some servants around. I might be hungry for a whole  tray  of fruit tarts. And maybe a little palanquin ride around town. Double time.,49
Aang,"Thanks for everything, guys.",49
Katara,"So, do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night's sleep?",49
Aang,"[  He turns his head away.  ] Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better. [  He looks back at his friends.  ] Maybe.",49
Sokka,Then our work here is done.,49
Katara,"What happened, Aang?",49
Aang,[  Turns away on hands and knees.  ] It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.,49
Sokka,Looks like it's time for another ... [  He turns around and puts his Wang Fire disguise on and voice.  ] therapy session.,49
Aang,[  Momentarily looking back.  ] No. That won't help. Nothing helps. There's only one thing I can do! I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion!,49
Aang,Invasion. All aboard for the invasion.,49
Katara,[  Approaching.  ] You don't look so good. You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?,49
Aang,"I told you, I can't go back to sleep.",49
Katara,"Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you.",49
Aang,"[  Walking toward the cliff edge. Katara turns and moves a bit to follow.  ] Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think. And I've realized some big things, Katara.",49
Katara,What big things?,49
Aang,"I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this. [  He turns around to look at Katara.  ] I'm doing it to save the world. But more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. [  Side shot of Aang and Katara near each other.  ] I'm doing it for you, Katara.",49
Katara,"Aang, what are you saying?",49
Aang,"I'm saying, I love you! [  He kisses her. After he pulls back, she embraces and kisses him back.  ]",49
Katara,"[  After kissing for a while she pulls back, whispering slightly.  ] What are we doing?",49
Aang,"What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby, [  He moves Katara down to the side.  ] you're my forever girl. [  Aang puckers up his lips for another kiss.  ]",49
Katara,"Aang! [  Aang realizes he was just daydreaming, and realizes he is not holding Katara anymore.  ] I was just saying you should take a nap.",49
Aang,"[  He quickly turns around to face Katara.  ] Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream.",49
Katara,What was your dream about?,49
Aang,"[  He pauses to think for a moment.  ] Uh, living underwater?",49
Katara,"[  Initially confused, she smiles back.  ] Sounds neat!",49
Servant,"Prince Zuko, [  He bows before the prince.  ] everyone's waiting for you.",49
Zuko,What?,49
Servant,"The high admirals, the high generals, the war ministers, and the princess have all arrived. You're the only person missing.",49
Zuko,"So, my dad  wants  me at the meeting?",49
Servant,"The Fire Lord said he would not start until you arrived, sir.",49
Aang,"Put 'em up, Fire Lord!",49
Sokka,Hey! I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's  your  bison.,49
Aang,"[  Standing in front of the ""Ozai"" tree in a fighting stance.  ] Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach.",49
Aang,"You think you're untouchable, don't you, Mr. Fire Lord?",49
Momo,"[  Off-screen.  ] Boy, you are really starting to lose it, kid.",49
Aang,"Momo, did you hear something? [  Turns back.  ]",49
Momo,"[  Off-screen.  ] No, but I said something. [  Aang becomes shocked and gets close to Momo.  ] You, my friend, are just a few plums short of a fruit pie. [  Aang stares at Momo in disbelief, his jaw wide open. He quickly stands up, shakes his head, and covers his eyes. He peeks through them, at which point Momo begins chittering normally again. Aang walks up to him and pets him.  ]",49
Aang,"That's more like it. I'm so tired that for a second there, I imagined you were talking to me. [  Momo tilts his head in confusion. Everyone is seen walking forward and watching Aang.  ] Oh, Momo, let me explain. [  Aang begins chattering like Momo. Katara and Sokka share a look of confusion, as Toph merely stands there with a slightly annoyed look. Momo chitters back, in which Aang laughs before chittering again. Katara interrupts him.  ]",49
Katara,Aang? We're all starting to get a little worried about you.,49
Sokka,You've been awake too long.,49
Toph,And you're acting downright weird.,49
Appa,You've got to take care of yourself. You can't go on like this.,49
Aang,"[  Sighs.  ] Look, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but the stress and the nightmares. They were just too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it.",49
Momo,[  Standing and pointing at Appa.  ] Yeah! Leave the kid alone!,49
Appa,"[  Pointing back.  ] Hey, who asked  you  ? [  The two begin to fight.  ]",49
Aang,"You guys, come on.",49
Appa,No! I am sick of this guy always mouthing me and telling me what to do!,49
Momo,"Oh, you don't like it? Well, let's go right now!",49
Aang,"Sokka, what do we do?",49
Sokka,[  Confused.  ] About what?,49
Aang,[  Pointing.  ] About that!,49
Koala sheep,[  Cut to a group of koala sheep.  ] Appa! Appa! Appa! [  Cut to another group.  ] Momo! Momo! Momo!,49
Aang,"Come on, guys. We're all on the same side.",49
Pathik,"[  Singing.  ] Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras. Chakras, chakras, chakras sandwich tastes good. Yum!",49
Koala sheep,[  Cut to some koala sheep.  ] Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!,49
Aang,I just need to jump in a cold waterfall!,49
Mai,"So, how did it go? [  They walk on together.  ]",49
Zuko,"When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me. My father had saved me a seat. He wanted me next to him. I was  literally  at his right hand.",49
Mai,"Zuko, that's wonderful! You must be happy.",49
Zuko,"During the meeting, I was the perfect prince. The son my father wanted. [  Looks down, eyes closed.  ] But I wasn't me.",49
Aang,"Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds.",49
Toph,Hey! It's real! We spent  hours  working on it.,49
Sokka,We made it for you. A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away. We hope.,49
Aang,"Look! You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't! The invasion's tomorrow!",49
Katara,[  Concerned.  ] Aang ...,49
Aang,"No, Katara! There's still  so  much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I  need  is practice. Quick, hit me! [  He begins to wobble.  ]",49
Katara,I'm  not  going to hit you.,49
Toph,You want me to do it? [  Sokka nudges her back.  ],49
Katara,"[  Approaching Aang, placing a hand on his shoulder.  ] Listen to me. You've been training for this since the day we met. [  Moves behind him, talking over his shoulder.  ] I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough.",49
Aang,You really think so? [  Katara nods.  ],49
Sokka,We all do. You can do this. You're ready.,49
Toph,"You're the man, Twinkle Toes!",49
Aang,"Thanks, guys. [  He nods, yawns, and rubs his eyes. Katara aids him to the bed, where he lies down.  ] You know what? I think I am ready. [  The other three watch as he falls asleep quickly. He falls into another dream, meeting with Ozai again.  ] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!",49
Ozai,Really? You're gonna take me out? You're not even wearing pants!,49
Aang,"[  Smiles smugly.  ] No, Fire Lord Ozai.  You're  not wearing any pants.",49
Ozai,No! My royal parts are showing.,49
Aang,"[  Momo jumps onto his shoulder; cheerfully.  ] Top of the morning, Momo!",50
Katara,[  Rises and places hands on hips.  ] Sounds like you slept well.,50
Aang,[  Moves his hand aside in a sweeping motion.  ] Like a baby moose lion. [  Assumes a fighting stance and raises fists; exuberantly.  ] I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.,50
Toph,"So, what's your strategy for taking him down? [  Smiling and raises her hands to her eyes, her fingers wiggling outward in a mimicry of the Avatar State.  ] Gonna get your glow on and [  Punches the air with a determined expression on her face.  ] hit him with a little Avatar State action?",50
Aang,"[  Looks down sorrowfully.  ] I can't. [  Cut to side-view of him, the camera panning slightly to the left.  ] When Azula shot me with lightning, [  Close his eyes briefly.  ] my seventh chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the universe. [  Cut back to shot of him and Toph.  ]",50
Toph,"You know what I just heard? [  Holds up one hand and opens and closes it in a ""gibber-gabber"" expression.  ] Blah, blah, spiritual mumbo jumbo blah, blah, something about space. [  Bored.  ]",50
Katara,"[  Cut to a wide shot of the ocean; thick fog is visible on the horizon.  ] Oh, no. [  Cut to a shot of Katara, appearing concerned.  ] Sokka, do you think the fog will delay the invasion?",50
Sokka,"[  Stands up.  ] No. [  Cut to close-up of the fog, five Water Tribe ships suddenly appearing from amid the mist.  ] That  is  the invasion!",50
Katara,"You made it, Dad! [  Cut to shot of Katara embracing her father happily.  ]",50
Sokka,[  Spirited.  ] Were you able to locate everyone I told you to find?,50
Hakoda,"I did. [  Two members of the Foggy Swamp Tribe disembark. Doubtfully.  ] But I'm a little worried, Sokka. Some of these men aren't exactly the ""warrior type"". [  Turns head slightly toward the two swamp dwellers.  ]",50
Due,"[  Enthusiastically, swinging his arm.  ] Oooh-whee! [  Cut to shot of the two men standing on the dock.  ] This place ain't nothing like a swamp. [  Points accusingly to a rock in the water.  ] What you reckon that is, Tho? Some sort of Fire Nation exploding trap what eat ya?",50
Tho,"[  Impartial.  ] It's just a rock, Due.",50
Due,"[  Grins.  ] Well, I'll be. [  Scratching his head.  ]",50
Hakoda,"Is it just me, or are those fellas a little loose in the leaf-hat?",50
Bato,"[  Walks past, behind the chief and his family, stopping beside Sokka.  ] I just wish they would wear pants.",50
Huu,"[  Cut to shot of Huu standing alone on the dock. Scratches his stomach.  ] Pants are an illusion, and so is death.",50
Haru,"[  Off-screen.  ] Hi, Katara. [  Cut to close-up of the figure who reveals himself to be Haru; he smiles, now sporting a small mustache and goatee.  ]",50
Katara,[  Cut to zoomed out shot of Haru.  ] Haru! [  Runs over and embraces him.  ] It's so good to see you!,50
Aang,"[  Appears on screen with Toph.  ] Toph, this is Haru. When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation. So he had to hide his earthbending.",50
Haru,[  With Katara resting a hand on his shoulder.  ] Katara inspired me and my father to take back our village. [  Turns to Katara who blushes and looks away.  ],50
Tyro,"[  Tyro appears and lays his hands on Haru's and Katara's shoulders.  ] You helped us find our courage, Katara. [  Katara turns to him.  ] Now we're here to help you.",50
Toph,No way! Is that-,50
Big Bad Hippo,Hippo happy to see Blind Bandit!,50
Toph,[  Angrily.  ] You guys here for a rematch?,50
The Boulder,"Negatory. The Boulder and The Hippo no longer fight for others' entertainment. Now, we fight for our kingdom!",50
Toph,[  Smiling.  ] Sweet.,50
Sokka,Was that a new invention?,50
Mechanist,"[  Teo licking his fingers clean.  ] Yes, but unfortunately the incendiary capabilities of peanut sauce prove to be a failure.",50
Sokka,[  The others seems disgusted.  ] You're making peanut sauce bombs?,50
Pipsqueak,They're destructive.,50
The Duke,"And delicious. [  They both lick the sauce that splashed all over their faces. Momo flies over to Pipsqueak and starts licking his face, much to his and The Duke's amusement.  ]",50
Sokka,Where you able to complete work on the plans I send you?,50
Mechanist,"Yes, I was, and I think the Fire Nation will be quite surprised.",50
Teo,"Aang, my dad and I made this for you.",50
Aang,A new glider! This is amazing!,50
Mechanist,"And as a special feature, I added the snack compartment. [  Rotates the handle, making the snacks come out.  ]",50
Aang,"Oh ... well, I'm sure that will come in handy.",50
Warden Poon,I bet you're tired of being in this cell old man. Well too bad. [  Camera shows Iroh's face.  ] You're never stepping outside these walls again.,50
Ming,[  Enters.  ] Breakfast.,50
Warden Poon,"[  Stands.  ] Careful, Ming, don't get too close. His stench will knock you right out. [  Leaves, laughing.  ]",50
Ming,[  Looks at Poon contemptuously and approaches Iroh.  ] I snuck in some white jade tea. I know you like rare teas.,50
Iroh,"[  Ming places the tray of tea inside Iroh's cell.  ] Thank you, Ming. Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me.",50
Hakoda,"Don't worry, you'll do great.",50
Sokka,"Good morning everyone. Ahh! [  Trips on stage.  ] Umm ... so, as you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation! I mean I know you know that because otherwise why else would you be here? [  Laughs nervously.  ] Uh anyway, [  Dropping scrolls. Unraveling one on a board.  ] the Fire Lord's palace is here [  Points at map, realizing it isn't the map, flips the chart several times until it is the map.  ]. Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh wait, it's here, [  Brief shot of Due scratching his head.  ] and uh, there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us! [  Brief shot of Teo and the mechanist looking on.  ] And ... um ... I'm sorry let me start at the beginning [  Stands up straight, and begins talking very fast.  ]. Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then we met Suki, [  Water Tribe warrior yawns.  ] who's a Kyoshi warrior. She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's friend was a crazy old king and ...",50
Katara,"[  Cut to Katara speaking over Sokka as he continues talking.  ] Wow, when he says the beginning he means the  beginning  beginning. [  Hakoda gets up and approaches Sokka.  ]",50
Sokka,... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if you look at him in the front row you can see it ...,50
Hakoda,"[  Interrupting.  ] Thank you, Sokka. It's okay why don't you take a break? [  Sokka leaves the stage to sit down, disappointed in himself. Hakoda addresses the crowd.  ] Let me just clarify a few points for everyone. [  Shot of Haru stroking his chin. Everyone pays attention to Hakoda.  ] Today, is the day of black sun, and I want to thank you all for your self-sacrifice, and your courage. There are two steps to the invasion, a naval stage, and then a land stage. [  Shot of Sokka looking down, sad, Katara, Momo and Aang looking at Hakoda and Toph.  ] To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital, we need to get past our first major obstacle here, [  Points at map.  ] The Great Gates of Azulon. Next, we hit the land, and we hit hard. We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower. Once we do that, it's up to the Royal Palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin.",50
The Boulder,"Excuse me. The Boulder is confused. Isn't the point to invade  during  the eclipse, when the firebenders are powerless?",50
Hakoda,"The eclipse only lasts eight minutes, not enough time for the whole invasion. And the Royal Palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the eclipse's advantage the  most  . When this is finished, the Avatar will have defeated the Fire Lord. We will have control of the Fire Nation capital, and this war will be over!",50
Aang,We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave.,50
Sokka,"I messed up, Aang.",50
Aang,What?,50
Sokka,The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it. I just fell apart.,50
Aang,"[  Approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.  ] Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that.",50
Sokka,"My dad is! He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should.",50
Aang,"Look, your moment of truth isn't gonna be in front of some map; it's gonna be out there on the battlefield.",50
Sokka,"You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win?",50
Aang,Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again.,50
Hakoda,"There they are, the Great Gates of Azulon.",50
Katara,I don't see any gates.,50
Hakoda,"Katara, you and the swamp benders whip up a fog cover.",50
Tho,We'll sneak by them statues just like we sneak by that Fire Navy blockade!,50
Hakoda,"Keep it up, we're almost through!",50
Hakoda,Everyone below deck! [  Everyone goes into the boats; to Sokka.  ] Let's hope your invention works.,50
Male Fire Nation soldier,"No one's on board, sir.",50
Female Fire Nation soldier,Where'd they go?,50
Hakoda,"[  Placing a hand on Sokka's shoulder.  ] You've really outdone yourself this time, son.",50
Toph,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, congratulations, Sokka. You managed to invent a worse way of travel than flying. [  She holds her mouth, about to throw up.  ]",50
The Duke,[  Takes off his helmet and offers it to Toph.  ] Helmet?,50
Sokka,"Well, I just came up with the idea. The mechanist did all the work.",50
Mechanist,"Now don't sell yourself short, my boy. [  Cut briefly to Katara and Huu waterbending.  ] It was your idea to use waterbending to make the subs sink and float, brilliant! [  Cuts back to the mechanist opening a scroll, revealing a very crude drawing of a submarine.  ] Though your original designs were a bit difficult to decipher. Unfortunately there is one problem I couldn't fix. [  Cut to outside of submarine as the submarines swim past, along with Aang on Appa.  ] The subs have a limited air supply. Before we land on the beaches, we'll need to resurface.",50
Ming,"Lunchtime, General Iroh. [  Whispers and looks back.  ] And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice.",50
Iroh,"Thank you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness have made my days in prison bearable. [  Thinks for a moment and smiles.  ] I think you should take the rest of the day off.",50
Ming,[  Confused.  ] What?,50
Iroh,You don't look well. Maybe you should go home and rest.,50
Ming,"No, I feel fine.",50
Iroh,[  Brief close-up of his face.  ] Trust me. It is better that you are not here this afternoon.,50
Aang,"[  To Toph, Sokka, and Katara, who approach him.  ] So, this is it huh?",50
Sokka,Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar is alive?,50
Aang,I'm ready. [  Sokka and Aang shake hands and the group hugs.  ],50
Toph,"I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, Twinkle Toes.",50
Hakoda,"Everyone listen up. [  Team Avatar comes out of the hug.  ] The next time we resurface, it'll be on the beaches. So stay alert, and fight smart. Now break time's over, back in the subs. [  Sokka, Toph, and Momo leave Katara and Aang standing alone together.  ]",50
Aang,"[  Turning to see Katara.  ] Katara, I ...",50
Katara,"[  Speaking at the same time.  ] Aang, I ...",50
Aang,You go first.,50
Katara,"We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore. [  Aang blushes.  ] I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you.",50
Aang,"Everything's gonna be different after today, isn't it.",50
Katara,"Yes, it is.",50
Aang,What if ... what if I don't come back?,50
Katara,"Aang, don't say that, of course you'll- [  Katara is cut off as Aang kisses her. After the kiss, Katara blushes and stares sadly after Aang as he confidently snaps his glider and flies away.  ]",50
Sokka,"Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge.",50
Katara,"What? Right, I'm on it. [  Jumps onto Appa and waterbends a sphere of water around his head before submerging.  ]",50
Zuko,I'm sorry Mai.,50
Aang,What do you know? It  did  come in handy.,50
Hakoda,"Everyone in position. Earthbenders, into your tanks. This is gonna be a rough ride.",50
Hakoda,Ready the torpedo. [  An ice-covered torpedo is loaded.  ] Launch!,50
Tho,"We're a man down. Where in tarnation is Huu? [  He and Due continue waterbending, launching a tank into the water.  ]",50
Due,[  Waves.  ] Hey Huu! Where you been? [  The seaweed opens to reveal Huu standing inside.  ],50
Huu,Communin' with nature. Takes a while to collect this much seaweed. [  Closes the seaweed again as he sees a large fireball coming straight toward him.  ],50
Sokka,"Dad, look out!",50
Hakoda,"Sokka, we've gotta take out those battlements! It's our only chance.",50
Sokka,I've got an idea.,50
Hakoda,"You two take out that battlement. [  Pointing to a battlement in the distance before leaving to another.  ] I got this one. Watch each other's backs. [  Cut to Sokka and Katara, shown breaking into their battlement, Katara freezing the soldiers inside. Sokka uses his sword to cut through the launcher, causing part of it to fall out and explode outside as Katara and Sokka exit the battlement. They see Hakoda on the roof of his as he climbs inside. They hear noises from the ensuing fight until the launcher shoots and explodes, hearing Hakoda yelling out in pain. Cut to Sokka and Katara's worried faces as Hakoda exits, wounded, and falls to the ground.  ]",50
Katara,Dad?,50
Sokka,Dad! [  The two run to his side.  ],50
Zuko,"I know I've made some bad choices, but today, I'm gonna set things right. [  He rises, picks up his sword, covers his head with the hood of his robe, turns his back to the camera and leaves.  ]",50
Katara,"How does that feel, dad?",50
Hakoda,"Ah, a little, better. I need, to get back to the troops. [  Attempts to stand but is too weak to.  ] Ahh!",50
Katara,"You're hurt, badly. You can't fight anymore.",50
Hakoda,"Everyone's counting on me to lead this mission Katara, I won't let them down. [  Attempts to stand again but can't.  ] Ahh!",50
Sokka,Can't you heal him any faster?,50
Katara,I'm doing everything I can.,50
Sokka,[  Looks around before looking confidant.  ] I'll do it.,50
Katara,"No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.",50
Sokka,No. [  Stands confidently.  ] I'll lead the invasion force.,50
Katara,Don't be crazy Sokka.,50
Sokka,"Maybe I am a little crazy, but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does.",50
Hakoda,You can do this. [  Cuts to a close-up of him.  ] I'm proud of you son.,50
Katara,"I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too.",50
Sokka,"[  Nods, puts his helmet on and boards Appa.  ] Yip yip.",50
Sokka,"Listen up, everyone. I want the tanks in wedge formation. Warriors and benders in the middle. We're taking that tower, and heading for the royal palace. [  All the tanks come together in wedge formation behind Appa, soldiers protected in the middle. Cut to Sokka, on Appa, who draws his sword and thrusts it forward.  ] Charge!",50
Aang,"[  Looking around.  ] That's strange. [  He continues onto the Royal Palace, breaks open the door, and takes a fighting stance.  ] The Avatar is back! [  Realizing no one is around he relaxes, looking confused.  ] Hello? Anyone home?",50
Tyro,The Fire Nation is falling back!,50
Bato,"Sokka, we're on our way to victory!",50
Aang,"No. [  Kneels down on the ground; frustrated.  ] No, no, no! Fire Lord Ozai, where are you!?",50
Sokka,[  Brightening.  ] Dad! [  Rising and approaching the two.  ] You're on your feet again.,51
Hakoda,"[  Sitting down; somewhat weakly.  ] Thanks to your sister. I'm in no shape to fight, but maybe there's some way I can help.",51
Sokka,Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.,51
Hakoda,"[  Katara moves away, sensing something in the distance.  ] Let's hope our luck holds out. [  Noticing her move away.  ] Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?",51
Katara,[  Quizzically.  ] Yeah. Is that ... is that  Aang  ?,51
Sokka,"[  Shocked.  ] What? [  Cuts to shot of Aang riding in on his glider, dodging several fireballs. He lands in front of the group.  ] Please tell me you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down.",51
Aang,[  Katara and Aang kneel with Sokka.  ] He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned.,51
Sokka,[  With epiphany; the camera shifts from a side-view of his face to a frontal view.  ] They knew.,51
Aang,[  Dismayed.  ] It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long-gone; far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse.,51
Sokka,[  Thoughtfully.  ] No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker; somewhere he could go and be safe during the siege but still be close enough to lead his nation.,51
Toph,"If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, [  Points to herself.  ] I'm just the girl to find it.",51
Sokka,[  Pulling out mechanism.  ] The mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about ten minutes until the full eclipse. Ten minutes to find the Fire Lord.,51
Aang,We can still do this. We can still win the day.,51
Katara,[  Worried.  ] Wait! If they knew we were coming it could all be a trap. [  Looks at the others; the camera pans to the right.  ] Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure we all get out of here safely.,51
Hakoda,"Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it.",51
Sokka,"[  To Aang.  ] What do you think? You're the one that has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you.",51
Aang,"[  Rising, turning his back to the group, determined.  ] I've gotta try.",51
Aang,Do you feel anything down there?,51
Toph,[  Placing her hand on the ground to feel vibrations.  ] Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano.,51
Sokka,Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?,51
Toph,"[  Taking her hands and digging her fingers into the surface.  ] There is something big, dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano.",51
Sokka,[  Raises arms up in the background.  ] Sounds like a secret bunker to me.,51
Aang,[  To Appa and Momo.  ] Stay safe. We'll be back soon.,51
Toph,[  Pointing.  ] This way! That one's a dead end!,51
Sokka,[  Following her.  ] What would we do without you?,51
Toph,[  Camera view changes to show the group walking past magma channels.  ] Perish in burning hot magma.,51
Sokka,"[  Observing the magma channels; blushing.  ] Yeah, pretty much.",51
Toph,The tunnel continues on the other side and It leads right to the bunker.,51
Sokka,"We'll have to be fast, but careful.",51
Aang,How is that careful?,51
Sokka,"I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky.",51
Sokka,There's no floor. It's just a river of lava.,51
Aang,[  Spinning his staff open.  ] Climb aboard and hold on tight.,51
Sokka,[  Impressed.  ] That's some door!,51
Toph,[  Walks over to the door and bangs the metal with her fist.  ] Not a problem.,51
Sokka,[  Entering the bunker while making some hand movements.  ] I am so glad we added you to the group!,51
Fire Nation Captain,[  Witnessing the sun as the moon begins to overshadow it.  ] Retreat! Everyone move to the secondary defensive position! Retreat!,51
Bato,[  Standing from the side of an Earth Kingdom tank.  ] The eclipse is only minutes away. We should be able to make it up to hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time it's finished.,51
Katara,[  Stopping with her father.  ] We can wait here if you want.,51
Hakoda,[  Determined.  ] No. I wanna press forward with the others.,51
Qin,"[  Out of fear.  ] The Fire Lord's chamber is that way, down the hall, to the left, [  Makes climbing motions with his fingers.  ] and up the stairs, you can't miss it!",51
Aang,[  Suspicious look suddenly becomes friendly.  ] Thanks!,51
Sokka,Only thirty seconds until the total eclipse.,51
Aang,I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.,51
Azula,"So, you are alive after all. [  Aang stares at her in shock.  ] I had a hunch that you survived. But it doesn't matter. [  Proudly.  ] I've known about the invasion for months.",51
Zuko,[  To himself.  ] I'm ready to face you.,51
Ozai,Prince Zuko? What are you doing here?,51
Mechanist,The eclipse is starting! [  Pulls out specialized eyewear and puts it on.  ] Put on your eclipse glasses!,51
Ozai,Why are you here?,51
Zuko,I'm here to tell the truth.,51
Ozai,[  Off-camera.  ] Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse. [  Cuts to shot of him.  ] This should be interesting.,51
Zuko,"First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.",51
Ozai,Why would she lie to me about that?,51
Zuko,Because the Avatar's not dead. He survived.,51
Ozai,[  Shocked and horrified.  ] What?,51
Zuko,"In fact, he's probably leading this invasion. He could be on his way here right now.",51
Ozai,[  Rises from his seat and points toward the door.  ] Get out! Get out of my sight right now if you know what's good for you!,51
Zuko,That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore.,51
Ozai,"[  Angrily.  ] You will obey me, or this defiant breath will be your last!",51
Zuko,"[  Pulls out his swords.  ] Think again. I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen.",51
Aang,Where is he? Where's the Fire Lord?,51
Azula,[  Rises from throne.  ] You mean I'm not good enough for you? [  Acts hurt.  ] You're hurting my feelings.,51
Sokka,"Stop wasting our time and give us the information. [  Points sword at her.  ] You're powerless right now, so you're in no position to refuse.",51
Toph,[  Appears on scene and clenches fist.  ] And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying.,51
Azula,[  Walking a few steps forward.  ] Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar. [  Pauses slightly.  ] I am a four-hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.,51
Toph,"[  Cuts to Toph; short pause.  ] Okay, you're good, I admit it. [  Traps Azula using earthbending.  ] But you ought to consider telling the truth anyway!",51
Azula,[  Brushing off dust.  ] When I left Ba Sing Se I brought home some souvenirs: Dai Li agents!,51
Bato,"Surround the periphery! [  Raises spear.  ] We have to secure the palace by the time the eclipse is over! Otherwise, we'll be in for the fight of our lives.",51
Tyro,Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won't harm you.,51
Fire Nation soldier,"We'll never surrender! [  Makes frenzied motions and tries to firebend, but cannot.  ] Okay, we surrender. [  Fire Nation soldiers back down.  ]",51
Hakoda,[  Happily.  ] There it is: the Fire Nation Royal Palace. We've come so far.,51
Katara,[  Doubtful.  ] It's not over yet.,51
Zuko,"For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn. [  Points a broadsword at his father.  ] My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai. [  Cuts to shot of Ozai, looking angered.  ] How could you possibly justify a duel with a child?",51
Ozai,[  Scornful.  ] It was to teach you respect!,51
Zuko,It was cruel! And it was wrong.,51
Ozai,[  Angrily.  ] Then you have learned nothing!,51
Zuko,"No, I've learned everything! And I've had to learn it on my own! Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don't see our greatness. They hate us! And we deserve it! [  Camera view shows top profile of Zuko and Ozai through an overhead grate.  ] We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself [  Cuts to shot of Zuko.  ], we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.",51
Ozai,"[  Laughs.  ] Your uncle has gotten to you, hasn't he?",51
Zuko,Yes. [  Smiles proudly.  ] He has.,51
Aang,[  While running.  ] I can't pin her down! She's too quick!,51
Sokka,[  Stops running.  ] Wait! Aang! Toph! Stop attacking! Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!,51
Azula,[  Calmly.  ] Not true. I'm giving it my all.,51
Toph,[  Angrily.  ] You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!,51
Azula,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Um, right, I think your friend just said that, genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes. [  Rolls her eyes in disgust.  ]",51
Toph,[  Angrily.  ] I'll roll your whole head!,51
Sokka,She's just baiting you again.,51
Aang,"Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her?",51
Sokka,We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.,51
Azula,[  Coolly.  ] It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you.,51
Sokka,[  Waves hand up in gesture.  ] Ignore!,51
Azula,"[  Craftily.  ] So, Sokka's your name, right? My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time. [  Sokka stops walking and casts Azula a suspicious glance.  ] She was convinced you were going to come rescue her. Of course you never came, and she gave up on you.",51
Azula,[  Evilly to herself.  ] Come and get it.,51
Sokka,Where. Is. Suki?!,51
Zuko,"After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness. [  Cuts to shot of Ozai.  ] He's the one who's been a real father to me.",51
Ozai,"[  Laughs.  ] Oh, that's just beautiful. And maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure.",51
Zuko,But I've come to an even more important decision. [  Closes eyes and momentarily pauses.  ] I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you.,51
Ozai,"[  Smugly.  ] Really? Since you're a full-blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless. You've got your swords. Why don't you just do it now?",51
Zuko,Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny. [  Puts his swords away.  ] Goodbye.,51
Ozai,"[  Camera focuses on Zuko walking away, the Fire Lord in the background, now on his feet.  ] Coward! You think you're brave enough to face me, but you'll only do it during the eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the sun comes out. Don't you want to know what happened to your mother?",51
Zuko,What happened that night?,51
Ozai,"My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son, and I was going to do it. [  Cuts to side-view of Zuko.  ] Your mother found out and swore she would protect you at any cost. [  Camera focuses on Ozai.  ] She knew I wanted the throne and she proposed a plan, a plan in which I would become Fire Lord and your life would be spared.",51
Sokka,Where's Suki? Answer me!,51
Aang,"[  Grabs Sokka's shoulder as camera pans slightly to the right.  ] Sokka, she won't talk.",51
Sokka,[  Ignores him.  ] Where are you keeping her?,51
Ozai,"Your mother did vicious, treasonous things that night. She knew the consequences and accepted them. For her treason, she was banished.",51
Zuko,[  Grows teary-eyed.  ] So she's alive?,51
Ozai,[  Calmly.  ] Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason. [  Ozai closes his eyes. Shot fades to outside where the solar eclipse begins to end.  ] Your penalty will be far steeper.,51
Azula,"Oh, sounds like the firebending's back on.",51
Azula,[  Rises and smirks.  ] Dad's all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to see you now.,51
Sokka,[  Ashamed.  ] I fell for it! I used up all our time.,51
Toph,"It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out.",51
Sokka,[  Sorrowfully.  ] And now it's too late.,51
Aang,Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over. But I can face the Fire Lord anyway.,51
Sokka,[  Matter-of-factly.  ] No. I don't think that's a good idea.,51
Aang,But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me.,51
Toph,The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go and help our friends.,51
Aang,[  Disappointed.  ] I guess you guys are right.,51
Sokka,[  Placing a hand on Aang's shoulder.  ] You'll have another chance. I know you will.,51
Bato,"What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now?",51
Hakoda,"I don't know. [  Katara crosses her arms in scorn.  ] But now that the eclipse is over, I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute.",51
Mechanist,"[  Off-camera.  ] My own invention. [  Cuts to shot of him.  ] Oh, this is terrible!",51
Katara,They're back!,51
Sokka,"[  Getting off Appa.  ] It was all a trap! Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move! [  Toph gets off, too.  ] We've just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. [  Hakoda approaches.  ] If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.",51
Aang,"They've got air power, but so do I! [  Cut to Aang as he opens his glider.  ] I'm gonna do what I can to slow them down. [  He tosses his glider into the air and takes off, Momo following close behind.  ]",51
Katara,"Appa, you and I can help too. [  Mounts Appa and follows Aang.  ]",51
Sokka,"Everyone, let's get back to the subs! [  Begins running.  ]",51
Katara,We can't keep them all back! There's too many of them!,51
Aang,Let's join the others! [  Dodges another fireball.  ],51
Zuko,Uncle! [  Zuko sees a big hole in Iroh's cell and sees Warden Poon on the ground; grabs a dazed Poon by the collar.  ] Where is my uncle?,51
Warden Poon,"[  Bewildered and terrified.  ] He's gone. He busted himself out. I've never seen anything like it, he was like a one-man army!",51
Sokka,Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs!,51
Katara,Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?,51
Aang,[  Thoughtfully.  ] They're heading for the beach ... [  Alarmed.  ] They're gonna destroy the submarines!,51
Sokka,[  Hopelessly.  ] How are we all going to escape?,51
Hakoda,"[  Approaching, helped by Bato.  ] We're not.",51
Sokka,"[  Looks determined.  ] Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win.",51
Hakoda,"Yes, with the Avatar we could still win. On another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together.",51
Katara,[  Surprised.  ] What? [  Grabs Hakoda.  ] We can't leave you behind! [  Looks at the rest of the invasion force.  ] We won't leave anyone behind!,51
Hakoda,You're our only chance in the long run. You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe. [  Katara looks back at Aang and Sokka sorrowfully.  ] It's the only way to keep hope alive.,51
Bato,"The youngest of our group should go with you. The adults will stay behind and surrender. We'll be prisoners, but we'll all survive this battle.",51
Tyro,"[  Approaching the two.  ] I've got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons. It's not going to be easy, but we'll get by.",51
Sokka,"[  Turning, alarmed.  ] They're at the beach already!",51
Mechanist,"[  Rising on an earth column along with Toph and helps son mount Appa.  ] Bye, son. [  Hugs Teo.  ]",51
Teo,"Bye, Dad. I'm really proud of you.",51
The Duke,"[  Struggling to mount Appa.  ] I'll miss you, Pipsqueak.",51
Pipsqueak,"[  Propping The Duke onto the saddle.  ] Take care, The Duke.",51
Haru,"[  Hugs his father.  ] We'll be back for you, Dad.",51
Tyro,If we don't escape on our own first.,51
Hakoda,"[  Hands on both Sokka and Katara's shoulders.  ] We lost today, but we've never been this close. [  Kneels down to face his two children.  ] We tasted victory, and that counts for something.",51
Katara,"We'll miss you, Dad. [  The two hug him.  ]",51
Sokka,"Bye, Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise.",51
Aang,Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm gonna make this up to you.,51
Fire Nation soldier,"Should we follow them, princess?",51
Azula,"No, they're too fast. It doesn't matter. They'll be back. [  Smiles evilly.  ]",51
Aang,[  Looking at the airship in the distance then looks ahead.  ] I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple!,51
Katara,This is humiliating.,52
Sokka,[  Looking up at her.  ] You mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?,52
Katara,[  Looking at him momentarily before answering.  ] Both.,52
Aang,"[  He pets Appa, smiling slightly.  ] Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired carrying all these people.",52
Teo,I wonder how the rest of the troops are.,52
Haru,[  Frontal view.  ] They're probably on their way to a prison. Seems like my dad just got out and now he's going back in.,52
The Duke,I miss Pipsqueak.,52
Sokka,I miss not having blisters on my feet.,52
Toph,"Hey, we're here! I can feel it!",52
Katara,Uhhh ... I think your feet need their eyes checked.,52
Aang,"No, she's right. We  are  here!",52
Toph,Wow ... it's amazing!,52
Iroh,What a stunning view.,52
Zuko,The only view I'm interested in seeing is the Avatar in chains.,52
Iroh,"You know, the Avatar hasn't been seen for one hundred years. The chances of finding him here are  very  slim. [  Cut to a shot of Zuko's bandaged side.  ]",52
Zuko,"[  Determined.  ] First we'll check each of the air temples, then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him.",52
Iroh,"Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment. You should take some time to heal and rest.",52
Zuko,"What else would I expect to hear from the  laziest  man in the Fire Nation? [  Iroh sighs.  ] The only way to regain my honor is to find the Avatar, so I will.",52
Teo,It's so different from the Northern Air Temple. I wonder if there are any secret rooms.,52
Haru,[  Running off to explore.  ] Let's go check it out!,52
Katara,You guys go. I think we need to talk about some things.,52
Teo,"I'll race you, Duke.",52
The Duke,"I told you, it's  The  Duke!",52
Aang,Why can't I go?,52
Katara,"We need to decide what we're gonna do now, and since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this.",52
Aang,"[  Sitting down.  ] Fair enough. So, what's the new plan?",52
Sokka,"Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan! You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.",52
Aang,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Oh, yeah. That's great, no problem. I'll just do that.",52
Katara,"Aang, no one said it's going to be easy.",52
Aang,"Well, it's not even gonna be possible! Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?",52
Katara,We could look for Jeong Jeong!,52
Aang,[  Shooting her idea down.  ] Yeah ... right. [  He lays down on the bench without a care.  ] Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.,52
Toph,"[  Curiously.  ] Who's ... oh, [  She folds her arms irritably.  ] never mind. If it's important I'll find out.",52
Aang,"Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we just take a nice tour around the temple? [  He and Momo fly off.  ]",52
Toph,What's up with him?,52
Sokka,There's gotta be someone who can teach him firebending.,52
Zuko,"Hello ... [  Raises an arm in greeting.  ] Zuko here, but I guess [  Rubs his hand against the back of his head nervously.  ] you probably already know me, sort of. Uhhh ... so, the thing is I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm [  Places an arm on his chest with pride.  ] considered to be pretty good at it. [  He continues smiling.  ] Well, you've seen me, you know, when I was attacking you. [  His eyes widen.  ] Uhhh ... yeah, I guess [  Places his fingers against his forehead in embarrassment.  ] I should apologize for that. But anyway, [  Waves an arm to the side dismissively.  ] I'm good now. [  Clenches both fists and places one on his chest while the other arm is raised.  ] I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad, [  He gets visibly uncomfortable and drops his arms into a slouch.  ] but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught [  Straightens up with a sincere expression on his face.  ] the Avatar firebending. [  A badgerfrog croaks at him. Angrily.  ] Well, what's your answer? [  The badgerfrog hops on his head before hopping away.  ] Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too. How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? [  Imitating Iroh.  ] Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself. [  Normal voice.  ] Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means. What would Azula do? [  Imitating Azula.  ] Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends. Your choice. [  Normal voice. Stops and sits down.  ] I guess I'm just not that good at impersonations.",52
Katara,"Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?",52
Aang,What? The wind is too loud in my ears! Check out this loop!,52
Sokka,"Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future!",52
Aang,"Okay, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table! Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber!",52
Toph,[  Cut to a close up of Toph as she turns serious.  ] I think that'll have to wait.,52
Zuko,[  Cut to a close up of Zuko's face.  ] Hello ... [  Raises his arm up in greeting and waves.  ] Zuko here.,52
Zuko,"Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so, I just thought I'd wait for you here. [  Appa growls at him and licks him twice. Cut to a surprised Momo and Aang as he lowers his staff slightly.  ] I know you must be surprised to see me here.",52
Sokka,"Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.",52
Zuko,"Right. Well, uhhh ... anyway ... what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I, uhhh, I'm good now, and well I think I should join your group, oh, and I can teach firebending to you. [  The gang expresses shock.  ] See, I, uhhh ...",52
Toph,You want to  what  now?,52
Katara,"You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?!",52
Sokka,"Yeah, all you've ever done is hunt us down and try to capture Aang!",52
Zuko,"I've done some good things! I mean, I could have stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free. That's something! [  Appa licks him again, much to his surprise.  ]",52
Toph,Appa [  The siblings turn toward her.  ] does seem to like him.,52
Sokka,He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not buying it.,52
Zuko,"I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes in the past.",52
Sokka,Like when you attacked our village?,52
Katara,Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us?,52
Zuko,"Look, I admit I've some awful things. I was wrong to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe. And I never should have sent that Fire Nation assassin after you. [  Toph and Sokka's eyes widen with shock.  ] I'm going to try and stop-",52
Sokka,"[  Pulls out his boomerang; angrily.  ] Wait, you sent Combustion Man after us?",52
Zuko,"Well, that's not his name, but-",52
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Ohhh, sorry. I didn't mean to insult your friend!",52
Zuko,[  Angrily.  ] He's not my friend!,52
Toph,That guy locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us all up!,52
Zuko,[  To Aang.  ] Why aren't you saying anything? You once said you thought we could be friends. You know I have good in me.,52
Aang,There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done. We'll never let you join us.,52
Katara,You need to get out of here. Now.,52
Zuko,I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore!,52
Sokka,"Either you leave, or we attack.",52
Zuko,"If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner. [  Zuko kneels down, bends his head, and raises his arms in surrender.  ]",52
Katara,"No, we won't! [  Blasts water at him.  ] Get out of here, and don't come back! And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again!",52
Zuko,"Uggh! I can't believe how stupid I am! I mean, what was I thinking? Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula did that? They would have believed that! Stupid! [  A badgerfrog croaks at him.  ] Uggh!",52
Katara,Why would he try to fool us like that?,52
Sokka,Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.,52
Katara,This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se. He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.,52
Sokka,"He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes.",52
Katara,"The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price. We can't trust him.",52
Aang,I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?,52
Sokka,And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!,52
Katara,"Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there!",52
Sokka,I could feel it! It's my throatal flap!,52
Aang,"Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out. He risked his life to save me.",52
Katara,No way! I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself!,52
Sokka,"Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him.",52
Aang,You're probably right.,52
Katara,And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar!,52
Toph,"Actually, he wasn't lying.",52
Sokka,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list.",52
Toph,"I'm just saying that, considering his messed-up family and how he was raised, he could have turned out a lot worse.",52
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] You're right, Toph! Let's go find him and give him a medal. The ""not as much of a jerk as you could have been"" award!",52
Toph,"All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly.",52
Katara,Easy for you to say! You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates!,52
Sokka,Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island!,52
Aang,Or when he tried to capture me at the Fire Temple!,52
Katara,Why would you even try to defend him?,52
Toph,"[  Angrily.  ] Because Katara, you're all ignoring one crucial fact: [  Pokes Aang in the chest.  ] Aang needs a firebending teacher! We can't think of a single person in the world to do the job! Now one shows up on a silver platter, and you won't even think about it? [  Stamps her feet on the ground to a point where the ground shakes slightly.  ]",52
Aang,I'm  not  having Zuko as my teacher!,52
Sokka,"You're darn right you're not, buddy.",52
Katara,"Well, I guess that settles that.",52
Toph,Ergh! I'm beginning to wonder who's really the blind one around here! [  Walks away.  ],52
Zuko,Who's there? Stay back! [  Whips fire.  ],52
Toph,"It's me! [  Throws up an earth shield, but steps back into Zuko's fire blast.  ] Ow! You burned my feet!",52
Zuko,"I'm sorry, it was a mistake! [  Comes toward her, but she begins to crawl away.  ]",52
Toph,"Get away from me! [  As Toph crawls away, she grabs the earth under her and throws it backward at Zuko.  ]",52
Zuko,Let me help you! [  Dodges another rock.  ] I'm sorry! [  Tries to grab her.  ],52
Toph,"Get off me, get off me! [  Brings up some earth which sends Zuko flying back.  ]",52
Zuko,"I didn't know it was you! Uggh, come back! [  Toph leaves.  ] Uggh! Why am I so bad at being good?",52
Katara,[  Handing a bowl to The Duke.  ] Has anyone seen Toph?,52
Sokka,I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.,52
Haru,Maybe she's just exploring the air temple. There are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending.,52
Katara,I think we should go look for her.,52
Sokka,[  Sitting.  ] Let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.,52
The Duke,We can go check for her!,52
Teo,[  Has a bandage around his forehead.  ] Yeah! I want to ride that tunnel down to the Hall of Statues again. It will work a lot better now that I fixed my brakes.,52
Katara,"[  Approaching, with Sokka and Aang. Worried.  ] Toph! What happened?",52
Toph,My feet got burned!,52
Katara,"Oh no, what happened?",52
Toph,"I just told you, my feet got burned!",52
Katara,"I meant, how.",52
Toph,"Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night. [  Everyone is shocked.  ]",52
Aang,You what?,52
Katara,Zuko?,52
Sokka,Uhhh ...!,52
Toph,"I thought he could be helpful to us. [  Katara begins to try and heal her feet.  ] And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out.",52
Sokka,So he attacked you?,52
Toph,"Well, he did, and he didn't. It was sort of an accident.",52
Aang,But he did firebend at you?,52
Toph,[  Sighs.  ] Yes.,52
Sokka,"See? You trusted Zuko, and you got burned. Literally!",52
Katara,It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better. [  Stops healing.  ] I wish I could have worked on them sooner.,52
Toph,"Yeah, me too.",52
Sokka,Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him.,52
Aang,"I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice.",52
Sokka,"He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him.",52
Toph,Maybe just invite him back here. [  Aang and Sokka go to pick her up.  ] He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once.,52
Sokka,"Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and  really  make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it! [  Aang and Sokka carry Toph away.  ]",52
Katara,"[  Following. Sarcastically.  ] You are a master of surprise, Sokka ...",52
Toph,"Ahhh, that's the stuff. Now I know how the rest of you guys feel. Not being able to see with your feet stinks. [  Katara sits next to her putting a hand on her shoulder.  ]",52
Zuko,"Stop! [  Team Avatar turns their head up to the sound.  ] I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore! [  Cut to a quick close up of Aang looking up with shock as he is helping Sokka carry Toph. Cut back to Zuko as he stands in front of Combustion Man, arms spread out to block him.  ] The mission is off. I'm ordering you to stop.",52
Zuko,"If you keep attacking, I won't pay you! [  Attempts to firebend at him, but Combustion Man grabs him.  ] All right, I'll pay you double to stop!",52
Toph,He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side!,52
Katara,I can't step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.,52
Sokka,"[  Pausing for a moment to think before having an idea.  ] I know how to get an angle on him! [  Takes out his boomerang. After another blast, he sneaks his head out, but has to hide from another shot. He projects Combustion Man's angle with his boomerang.  ] All right buddy, don't fail me now! [  Throws his boomerang.  ]",52
Sokka,"Yeah, boomerang! [  Jumps up and grabs it, but Combustion Man gets up, albeit clearly shaken.  ] Awww, boomerang ...",52
Aang,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... thanks, Zuko.",52
Sokka,"Hey, what about me? I did the boomerang thing.",52
Zuko,"Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. [  To Toph.  ] I'm sorry for what I did to you. [  Bows to her.  ] It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.",52
Aang,"[  Looks at Zuko shocked, hearing these words, and thinks for a moment.  ] I think you  are  supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me. [  Bows before Zuko.  ]",52
Zuko,[  Bows.  ] Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.,52
Aang,"Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them. [  To Toph.  ] Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?",52
Toph,Go ahead and let him join. [  Pounds her fist into her palm jokingly.  ] It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.,52
Aang,[  Turning to Sokka.  ] Sokka?,52
Sokka,"[  Shrugging.  ] Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then, I'm all for it.",52
Aang,[  Approaching Katara.  ] Katara?,52
Katara,[  Glares at Zuko for a moment and Zuko starts to sweat; reluctantly.  ] I'll go along with whatever you think is right. [  Aang smiles.  ],52
Zuko,[  Excitedly approaching the group.  ] I won't let you down! I promise!,52
Sokka,"So, here you go, home sweet home, I guess, you know, for now. Unpack? Lunch, soon? Uhhh ... welcome aboard? [  Zuko glances back and smiles at him.  ] Yeah. [  Walks out of the room and meets Aang in the hallway; to Aang.  ] Okay, this is really, really weird.",52
Zuko,"If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar. I know it's my destiny to capture him.",52
Iroh,"[  Placing a hand on his shoulder.  ] You know Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind, and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.",52
Katara,"You might have everyone else here buying your ... transformation, but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. [  Approaches him; threateningly.  ] So let me tell you something, right now. You make one step backward, [  Close-up of Zuko.  ] one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. [  Close-up of Katara's angry face.  ] Because I'll make sure your destiny ends ... right then and there. Permanently.",52
Zuko,"I know you're nervous, but remember, firebending in it of itself is  not  something to fear.",53
Aang,"[  Cut to Aang, as he sighs heavily.  ] Okay. Not something to fear.",53
Zuko,"[  Cut to Zuko from behind Aang.  ] But if you don't respect it, [  He raises his voice, as the camera zooms to a close-up of his face.  ] it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino!",53
Zuko,Now show me what you've got. Any amount of fire you can make.,53
Aang,Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration?,53
Zuko,[  Cut to an aerial shot of the both.  ] Good idea. You might wanna take a couple steps back.,53
Zuko,[  Takes a step back.  ] What was that? That was the worst firebending I've ever seen!,53
Aang,[  Cut to Aang.  ] I thought it was ... nice. [  Smiles slightly and shrugs.  ],53
Zuko,[  Frustrated.  ] Why is this happening?,53
Aang,"[  Rubbing his head, confused.  ] Maybe it's the altitude.",53
Zuko,"[  Turning back.  ] Yeah, could be.",53
Zuko,"Just breathe, and ... [  He delivers another blast with no improvement.  ]",53
Aang,[  Gets up.  ] That one kind of felt hot.,53
Zuko,[  Very angry.  ] Don't patronize me! You know what it's supposed to look like!,53
Aang,"Sorry, Sifu Hotman.",53
Zuko,"[  Raises his arms to his head, and throws them down back, and shouts in frustration, as Aang cringes.  ] And stop calling me that!",53
Sokka,"Hey, jerks! Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending?",53
Zuko,[  Frustrated.  ] Get out of here! [  He lashes his arm and points to a side.  ],53
Sokka,"Okay, take it easy. [  He drops his half-eaten apple.  ] I was just kiddin' around. [  He gets up and turns around, laughing as he adjusts his shirt.  ] Jerkbending, still got it. [  Zuko drops his head, dejected, and moans.  ]",53
Zuko,"Listen everybody, I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff. [  He looks below dejectedly.  ]",53
Toph,"[  Raises both hands to her head.  ] Don't look at me, [  She folds her arms.  ] I didn't touch your stuff.",53
Zuko,I'm talking about my firebending. It's gone. [  He looks below again.  ],53
Katara,"I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago.",53
Zuko,"[  Camera zooms back to show everyone sitting around the campfire and Zuko standing.  ] Well, it's not lost. It's just ... weaker for some reason.",53
Katara,[  Holding up her bowl and glaring at Zuko.  ] Maybe you're not as good as you think you are.,53
Toph,[  Screen pans left to Toph.  ] Ouch. [  She smiles sarcastically.  ],53
Zuko,[  With an idea.  ] I bet it's because I changed sides.,53
Katara,[  Still holding her bowl.  ] That's ridiculous. [  She drinks from the bowl.  ],53
Aang,I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to.,53
Sokka,"[  Leans toward Zuko and points a finger above.  ] Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough.",53
Zuko,"Okay, cut it out! [  Sokka stops poking, as his sword slips from his hands and is thrown above, before falling on his head. Zuko rubs his nose.  ] Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way.",53
Toph,"[  Cut to Toph, as Sokka sits near her, and rubs his head.  ] You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source. I recommend the original source. [  Eats the food from her bowl.  ]",53
Sokka,[  Excited.  ] How's he supposed to do that‌? By jumping into a volcano‌?,53
Toph,No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is.,53
Sokka,"[  Seriously.​  ] So, is it jumping into a volcano?",53
Toph,"I don't know. [  Places her bowl down as the shot cuts to a close-up of her face.  ] For earthbending, the original benders were badgermoles.",53
Toph,"[  Voice-over.  ] One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave.",53
Toph,That's where I met them.,53
Toph,"They were blind, just like me. [  The badgermole walks away as Toph attempts to crawls after it.  ] So we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending, [  Cut to an overhead shot of the badgermole, which moves its paws in a sweeping motion.  ] not just as a martial art, but as an extension of my senses. [  Screen fades to an overhead shot of Toph mimicking the creature's actions.  ] For them, the original earthbenders, [  The badgermole comes across a pile of rocks and earthbends them to the side.  ] it wasn't just about fighting. It was their way of interacting with the world. [  She stops crawling and stands up. She earthbends a stone and smiles at her success.  ]",53
Aang,"That's amazing, Toph!",53
Aang,"[  Cut to an aerial shot of the group.  ] I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison. [  Camera pans above to show a mural of three sky bison. Aang leans back to look at Appa.  ] Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy.",53
Zuko,"Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct.",53
Aang,"[  Shot cuts to behind Zuko as he looks at the group.  ] What do you mean‌? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of dragons when I was a kid.",53
Zuko,"[  Cut to Zuko's face, as he yells.  ] Well, they aren't around anymore, okay?",53
Aang,"Okay, okay. [  Moves his arms in an appeasing manner.  ] I'm sorry.",53
Zuko,But maybe there's another way. [  He walks toward a fountain.  ] The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors.,53
Aang,"[  Walks toward Zuko.  ] Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid.",53
Zuko,"[  Turning his head toward Aang.  ] No, they died off thousands of years ago. But their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now. [  Cut to a shot of the two from the side, as Zuko turns his head toward the Avatar.  ] Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins.",53
Aang,"It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.",53
Sokka,"So, what? [  Aang and Zuko look back at him and the shot cuts to Sokka seated.  ] Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing [  Moves his hand in a strange motion.  ] where they stood a thousand years ago?",53
Zuko,"[  Cut to an aerial shot.  ] More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend, [  Cut to a shot of the two from the side. Zuko turns his head toward Aang.  ] or the Avatar has to find a new teacher. [  Aang looks concerned and worried at Zuko's statement.  ]",53
Zuko,"We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster.",53
Aang,"[  Turning his head toward Zuko.  ] Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude.",53
Zuko,[  Whispering.  ] I can't believe this. [  He lies down.  ],53
Aang,"[  Cut to Appa flying from behind.  ] Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.",53
Aang and Zuko,Whoa!,53
Zuko,"Even though these buildings are ancient, there's something eerily familiar about them. [  Cut to Aang and Zuko walking.  ] I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these.",53
Aang,"[  Cut to some structures as screen pans right to show more of them.  ] Okay. We've learned something about architecture. [  Cut back to the two walking.  ] Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too. The past can be a great teacher.",53
Aang,"[  Scared.  ] Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.",53
Zuko,[  Kneeling down to inspect the spikes.  ] I can't believe it. [  He picks the tripwire up and examines it.  ] This booby trap must be centuries old and it still works.,53
Aang,There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.,53
Zuko,"[  Dusting some dirt on his shirt.  ] Where's that up-beat attitude you were talkin' about? [  He smiles, as Aang turns back. Cut to Zuko's point of view of the path as screen pans above to a building.  ] Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting.",53
Aang,"Look, this seems promising. [  Cut to Zuko and Aang from the behind, as they see a carving of a person being surrounded by two dragons who are breathing fire at him.  ] Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending.",53
Zuko,[  Cut to Zuko and Aang looking at the carving from the side.  ] They look pretty angry to me.,53
Aang,[  Cut to a part of the carving from below as screen pans right to show more of it.  ] I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors.,53
Zuko,"Well, they had a funny way of showing it.",53
Aang,"Zuko, [  Zuko stops walking.  ] something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years. [  Zuko closes his eyes.  ] Something you're not telling me.",53
Zuko,[  He opens his eyes.  ] My great-grandfather Sozin happened.,53
Zuko,"He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory. There were the ultimate firebenders. [  Cut to them walking from below the bridge, with the screen panning right as they walk.  ] And if you could conquer one, your firebending talents would become legendary and you'd earn the honorary title, Dragon. [  They approach a path which has one dragon's statue on both sides, and stop walking.  ] The last great dragon was conquered long before I was born, [  Cut to a close-up of one of the dragon's statue's eyes as Zuko places one of his palms on it.  ] by my uncle.",53
Aang,"[  Cut to the both from a side.  ] But I thought your uncle was ... I don't know, good?",53
Zuko,"He had a complicated past. [  Cut to Zuko's face.  ] Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on.",53
Aang,It's locked up!,53
Zuko,"Wait. [  Cut to an overhead shot of Zuko, as he realizes something and takes a step behind, and looks at the position he stood at a moment before. Screen zooms in to show the light from the sunstone beaming on a circular carving on the ground.  ] It's a celestial calendar. [  Cut to an aerial shot of Zuko and Aang standing in front of the column as screen pans to right to show the gates.  ] Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples. [  Cut to a similar sunstone above the gates.  ] I bet that sunstone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle. [  Screen pans below to show Aang in front of the gates.  ] On the solstice.",53
Aang,[  Exasperated.  ] Monkeyfeathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.,53
Zuko,"[  Cut to Zuko.  ] No, we can't. [  He unsheathes one of his swords.  ] But we might be able to speed time up. [  Cut to the circle carved on the ground on which light from the sunstone is being beamed. He places his sword on it with an angle, causing it to reflect the light. Cut to Zuko reflecting the light from the column.  ] Let's see if we can outsmart the sunstone.",53
Aang,Nothing's happening.,53
Zuko,"[  Cut to Zuko, who is kneeling down and reflecting the light.  ] Come on ...",53
Aang,"[  He picks his staff, and Zuko, walking up to the gates, unsheathes his sword.  ] You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you. [  Aang nudges Zuko with his elbow.  ] You're pretty smart.",53
Zuko,Relax. They're just statues.,53
Aang,It says this is something called the Dancing Dragon.,53
Aang,"Zuko, get over here! I want you to dance with me!",53
Zuko,[  He pulls his hand back.  ] What?,53
Aang,Just do it.,53
Aang,"Let's follow the steps of the statues. [  Aang and Zuko take the posture of the statue in front of them and move to their right and left, respectively, taking the postures of the statues in front of them, which pressed similar buttons lying on the ground in front of all the statues. Cut to an aerial shot of the room.  ] Don't you see? These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson. [  Cut to Zuko moving through each statue.  ] I think this is some kind of Sun Warrior firebending form.",53
Zuko,This better teach us some really good firebending.,53
Aang,"Hurray! [  Putting his hands down, and rubbing his head.  ] Wait, what exactly is that?",53
Zuko,[  He runs toward the sunstone.  ] It's some kind of mystical gemstone.,53
Aang,"[  Cut to the gemstone as Zuko runs toward it. Aang raises his arms.  ] Well, don't touch it! [  Zuko stops and Aang catches up to him.  ]",53
Zuko,Why not?,53
Aang,Remember what happened out there with those spikes? [  Turns to look at the side and raises his arms again.  ] I'm just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals.,53
Zuko,It feels almost alive.,53
Aang,"[  Cut to a worried Aang's face, as he turns to look at the gates of the room, which close.  ] Oh no, it's another trap!",53
Zuko,"Ugh, I can't pull free. It's like some kind of glue.",53
Aang,"[  Trying to pull his hands from the grates.  ] I can't move! Zuko, do something!",53
Zuko,Me? I can't move either!,53
Aang,It stopped.,53
Zuko,"At least we have air. Maybe if we stay calm, we can figure a way out of this.",53
Aang,"You  had  to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?",53
Zuko,"[  Cut to their heads sticking out from the grates.  ] At least I made something happen. If it were up to you, we'd never have made it past the courtyard.",53
Aang,[  He opens his mouth very widely and yells.  ] Help!,53
Zuko,Who are you yelling to? Nobody's lived here for centuries.,53
Aang,"Well, what do you think we should do?",53
Zuko,Think about our place in the universe‌?,53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Cut to Zuko and Aang's point of view, as the Sun Warrior chief comes into sight. Cut to his face.  ] Who is down there?",53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Walking toward the two.  ] For trying to take our sunstone, you must be severely punished!",53
Zuko,[  Cut to Aang and Zuko from the side.  ] We didn't come here to take your sunstone. We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.,53
Ham Ghao,"Yeah, right. They are obviously thieves, [  Cut to the chief and Ham Ghao from the side to show that he is holding the sunstone.  ] here to steal Sun Warrior treasures.",53
Aang,"Please, I don't normally play this card, but ... [  Places his palm on his chest.  ] I'm the Avatar. [  Cut to Ham Ghao looking toward the chief from the side, puzzled. Cut to Aang, who stands up and gives a weak smile.  ] Just hear us out.",53
Zuko,"[  Standing up.  ] My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. [  Looks down at the ground.  ] O-or at least I used to be. [  Cut to Zuko's point of view to the Sun Warriors as screen pans right to show more of them.  ] I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage. But now I want to learn the true way, [  Cut back to Aang and Zuko.  ] the original way. When we came here, I never imagined [  Cut to an aerial shot that shows the Sun Warriors surrounding the two.  ] the Sun Warrior's civilization was secretly alive. I am truly humbled to be in your presence. [  Cut back to the two, as they bow their heads.  ] Please, teach us.",53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Cut to the chief.  ] If you wish to learn the ways of the Sun, you must learn them from the masters, Ran and Shaw.",53
Aang,[  Cut to Aang and Zuko.  ] Ran and Shaw? There are two of them?,53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Walks toward them and looks at Aang.  ] When you present yourself to them, they will examine you. [  Turns to look at Zuko.  ] They'll read your hearts, your souls, and your ancestry. [  Takes a step toward Zuko and towers over Zuko, who looks worried.  ] If they deem you worthy, they'll teach you. [  Cut to a close-up of the chief.  ] If they don't, you'll be destroyed on the spot.",53
Sun Warrior chief,"If you're going to see the masters, [  Cut to an aerial shot of the Sun Warriors sitting in many arcs inside the room in front of the Eternal Flame. Aang, Zuko, and the Sun Warrior chief are standing.  ] you must bring them a piece of the Eternal Flame. [  Cut to the chief standing in front of the fire from behind him.  ] This fire is the very first one. [  Raises his hands to his head and turns back at Zuko and Aang.  ] It was given to man by the dragons. [  Cut to the chief talking to Zuko and Aang from the side as the other Sun Warriors look.  ] We have kept it going for thousands of years.",53
Zuko,[  Surprised.  ] I don't believe it.,53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Cut to the Sun Warriors sitting and the chief explaining their job to the two, as screen pans to the right.  ] You will each take a piece of it to the masters, to show your commitment to the sacred art of firebending.",53
Aang,"[  Cut to an unsure Aang as he places his palm on his neck.  ] Umm, Mister Sun Chief Sir‌, yeah, I'm not a firebender yet. [  Pointing to Zuko.  ] Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me?",53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Unyielding.  ] No. [  He turns back to face the fire. Cut to Aang, who looks very uneasy, before cutting to the chief, who takes a part of the Eternal Flame on his hand and turns back toward the two.  ] This ritual illustrates [  He turns around in a circle and splits the fire on his palm into two parts.  ] the essence of Sun Warrior philosophy. [  Cut to Aang, as he stares at the flame.  ] You must maintain a constant heat. The flame will go out if you make it too small. [  Aang cringes, as the screen pans to Zuko, who is standing beside Aang.  ] Make it too big, and you might lose control.",53
Aang,"I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous. [  He takes the flame in his hand and his expression changes to a relieved one.  ] It's like a little heartbeat.",53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Cut to the chief.  ] Fire is life, [  Cut to Aang. Screen zooms in to his face as he smiles.  ] not just destruction. You will take your flames up there. [  Cut to Zuko and Aang standing in front of the chief as he points to a mountain from the side. Screen zooms in to the mountain.  ] The cave of the masters is beneath that rock.",53
Zuko,Hurry up.,53
Aang,"I can't. [  Cut to Aang approaching a rock.  ] If I walk too fast, my flame will go out. [  Climbs up the rock and looks at his flame.  ]",53
Zuko,"Your flame's [  Aang looks at Zuko.  ] gonna go out [  Cut to Zuko from below.  ] because it's too small. You're too timid, give it more juice.",53
Aang,[  He climbs another rock.  ] But what if I can't control it?,53
Zuko,[  Cut to Zuko.  ] You can do it. I know you can. [  Cut to an unsure Aang.  ] You're a talented kid.,53
Sun Warrior chief,[  He and the other two Sun Warriors walk up to the two.  ] Facing the judgment of the firebending masters will be very dangerous for you. Your ancestors [  Cut to Zuko.  ] are directly responsible for the dragons' disappearance. [  Zuko looks toward the side.  ] The masters might not be so happy to see you.,53
Ham Ghao,[  He places his hand on his hip.  ] I know  I  wouldn't be.,53
Aang,But once they find out I'm the Avatar ...,53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Cut to the chief.  ] Have you forgotten that you vanished, allowing the Fire Nation to wreak havoc on the world‌? [  Cut to a guilty Aang.  ] The decline of the dragons is your burden, too. [  Aang looks toward the side.  ]",53
Aang,[  Turning to Zuko.  ] We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we'd hoped. [  Aang shows Zuko his flame and gives a weak smile.  ],53
Zuko,"No, we're seeing this through to the end. We're gonna meet these masters and find out [  Cut to an overhead shot of Aang.  ] what's so great about them.",53
Aang,"[  Looking toward the rocks.  ] What if they judge us, and attack us?",53
Zuko,"[  Cut to Zuko.  ] Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar. [  Unsheathes his swords slightly.  ] I think we could take these guys in a fight, whoever they are. [  He smiles.  ]",53
Zuko,Bring 'em out!,53
Sun Warrior chief,[  Cut to the chief to show him stretching his both hands out on both sides.  ] Chanters!,53
Sun Warrior,"[  Cut to a Sun Warrior using an sound-amplifying device.  ] Those who wish to meet the masters, Ran and Shaw, will now present their fire.",53
Sun Warrior chief,Sound the call!,53
Aang,"What's happening‌? [  He looks to look at Zuko, who turns his head toward Aang. Aang cringes and quickly returns back to his position, and realizes that his flame is extinguished and gasps. He turns toward Zuko again, and whispers.  ] Zuko, my fire went out.",53
Zuko,[  Whispering.  ] What do you want me to do‌?,53
Aang,Give me some of yours. [  He reaches for Zuko's flame and Zuko pushes him behind.  ],53
Zuko,"[  Whispering.  ] No, just make your own.",53
Aang,[  Whispering as well.  ] I can't. [  He reaches for Zuko's flame again.  ],53
Zuko,[  Cut to an aerial shot of the bridge.  ] Get some from those warriors. [  Cut to the chief and the two Warriors beside him.  ] Hurry! [  Cuts to shot of the Sun Warriors below; off-screen.  ] Stop cheating off me!,53
Aang,[  Off-screen.  ] Quit being stingy!,53
Aang,Uh oh.,53
Zuko,[  Cut to Zuko and Aang standing.  ] These are the masters.,53
Aang,[  In a low voice.  ] Still think we can take 'em?,53
Zuko,Sshh. I never said that.,53
Ham Ghao,"Oh, here it comes. [  Looks up at the bridge.  ] Any moment now. Dinner for the masters.",53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Turns toward Ham Ghao.  ] Quiet, Ham Ghao!",53
Ham Ghao,What? [  Turns his head away.  ] Everyone's thinking it.,53
Aang,"[  Whispers.  ] Zuko, I think we're supposed to do the Dragon Dance with them.",53
Zuko,[  Turning his head toward Aang.  ] What‌? What about this situation makes you think they want us to dance‌?,53
Aang,"Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it.",53
Zuko,[  Unwillingly.  ] Fine.,53
Sun Warrior chief,[  Still bowing.  ] Judgment time.,53
Aang,Wow.,53
Zuko,"[  Cut to Zuko's face, as he stares at the flames.  ] I understand.",53
Zuko,"[  Cut to Zuko.  ] Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined.",53
Aang,[  Cut to the two descending from the side.  ] Like firebending harmony.,53
Sun Warrior chief,"Yes. They judged you, and gave you visions of the meaning of firebending. [  The other two Sun Warriors walk away.  ]",53
Zuko,[  Cut to Zuko.  ] I can't believe there are still living dragons. My uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it.,53
Aang,[  Looking at Zuko.  ] So your uncle lied.,53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Cut to the smiling chief from the side.  ] Actually, it wasn't a total lie. Iroh was the last outsider to face the masters. [  Raising his hand above slightly.  ] They deemed him worthy and passed the secret onto him as well.",53
Zuko,"[  Surprised. Shot cuts to an aerial shot of the courtyard.  ] He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them.",53
Aang,"[  Cut to Aang.  ] All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life. [  He smiles.  ]",53
Zuko,"Yeah. It's like the Sun, [  He curls his hand into a fist.  ] but inside of you. Do you guys realize this?",53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  Smiling.  ] Well, our civilization is called the Sun Warriors ... so yeah.",53
Zuko,"That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many years, hunting you [  Turns toward Aang as screen zooms out to show Aang.  ] was my drive ... it was my purpose. [  Aang turns toward Zuko as well.  ] So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire. But now, I have a new drive. [  Cut to Zuko's face as screen zooms in.  ] I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world.",53
Sun Warrior chief,"[  He walks toward the two and become serious.  ] Now that you have learned the secrets, and you know about our tribe's existence, [  He stops walking.  ] we have no choice but to imprison you here forever. [  Cut to the two, who are shocked, before cutting back to the smiling chief.  ] Just kidding. [  Cut to the two as they look relieved. The chief's expression becomes serious again.  ] But seriously, don't tell anyone!",53
Aang,"[  Cut to Aang and Zuko demonstrating the Dancing Dragon to the rest of Team Avatar and friends.  ] With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable.",53
Sokka,"Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there.",53
Zuko,It's not a dance. It's a firebending form.,53
Sokka,"[  Cut to Sokka, as he moves his fingers in a dancing manner.  ] We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord.",53
Zuko,[  Walks toward Sokka.  ] It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!,53
Katara,"Oh, yeah‌? What's your little form called‌?",53
Zuko,[  Embarrassed.  ] The Dancing Dragon.,53
Zuko,"[  Cut to a tray full of tea cups with Zuko's hand holding a kettle and filling up the empty cups.  ] No one can make tea like Uncle [  Camera pans up to Zuko's face.  ], but hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?",54
Katara,Sure. [  Cut to an overhead of the group sitting around a fire.  ],54
Aang,I like jokes.,54
Toph,Bring it!,54
Zuko,"Okay. [  Serves tea to The Duke and Haru and stands up with his tray.  ] Well, I can't remember how it starts, but the punch line [  The boys help themselves to the tea.  ] is ""Leaf me alone, I'm bushed!"" [  No response.  ] Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.",54
Katara,Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing.,54
Toph,It's nice to get a chance to relax a little. It hardly ever happens.,54
Sokka,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second? [  Stands up and walks out.  ]",54
Zuko,"So, what's up? [  Appa wakes up and looks as they walk past him.  ]",54
Sokka,"If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?",54
Zuko,What do you mean? Who was captured?,54
Sokka,"When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where they might be.",54
Zuko,I can't tell you.,54
Sokka,What? Why not?,54
Zuko,"Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse. [  Turns to leave, but is stopped by Sokka.  ]",54
Sokka,It's my dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him through.,54
Zuko,"It's not good, Sokka.",54
Sokka,Please.,54
Zuko,"My guess is, they were taken to the Boiling Rock.",54
Sokka,What's that?,54
Zuko,"The highest security prison in the Fire Nation. [  Sokka looks at him, horrified.  ] It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake. It's inescapable.",54
Sokka,"So, where is this place?",54
Zuko,Why do you need to know? What are you planning?,54
Sokka,"Nothing. [  Pauses for a moment.  ] Boy, you're so paranoid.",54
Zuko,It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.,54
Sokka,"Thanks, Zuko. [  Yawns.  ] Just knowing makes me feel better.",54
Zuko,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, I'm sure it does.",54
Sokka,[  To Appa.  ] Shhh.,54
Zuko,"Not up to anything, huh?",54
Sokka,"[  Falls off Appa, his bag's contents fall out.  ] Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now?",54
Zuko,I'm never happy.,54
Sokka,"[  Picking up the fallen items.  ] Look, I  have  to do this. The invasion plan was  my  idea, it was  my  decision to stay when things were going wrong. [  Zuko jumps off of Appa.  ] It's  my  mistake, and it's  my  job to fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko. [  Pushes Zuko aside and begins to climb up Appa on Appa's saddle.  ]",54
Zuko,"You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.",54
Sokka,No. I have to do this alone.,54
Zuko,"How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares. [  Sokka stops climbing, sighs, and looks back at Zuko.  ] We'll take my war balloon. [  They walk off to the war balloon.  ]",54
Toph,What does it say?,54
Katara,"""Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko."" [  As she says this, Aang yawns and turns around to lie back down.  ] One more thing. ""Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko.""",54
Aang,"[  Sighs.  ] Nobody else has homework. [  Stands up and walks to a spot and starts hot squatting while Katara and Toph walk away.  ] One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ...",54
Sokka,Pretty clouds.,54
Zuko,Yeah ... fluffy. [  Sokka whistles.  ] What?,54
Sokka,"What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.",54
Zuko,No kidding.,54
Sokka,"Yep, a balloon ... but for war.",54
Zuko,"If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war. [  Blasts more fire into the tank.  ]",54
Sokka,"Yeah, it seems to run in the family.",54
Zuko,"[  Looks at Sokka, defensively.  ] Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that.",54
Sokka,"I know, I know, you've changed.",54
Zuko,[  Downcast.  ] I meant my uncle. He was more of a father to me. And I really let him down.,54
Sokka,I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's hard.,54
Zuko,It wasn't that hard.,54
Sokka,Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?,54
Zuko,"Well, I did have a girlfriend. Mai.",54
Sokka,[  Smiles and looks at Zuko with interest.  ] That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?,54
Zuko,[  Smiles.  ] Yeah. Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it.,54
Sokka,My first girlfriend turned into the moon.,54
Zuko,"[  Shocked for a moment. Looks up at the sky briefly, before glancing back at Sokka.  ] That's rough, buddy.",54
Zuko,"There it is! [  Sokka awakens to see it.  ] There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through it without being caught.",54
Zuko,[  Frantically blasting fire into the tank.  ] We're going down! The balloon's not working anymore! [  Blasts fire up into the balloon.  ],54
Sokka,The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly!,54
Zuko,[  Falls to the side as the balloon tips.  ] So what are we supposed to do?,54
Sokka,I don't know! Crash-landing?,54
Zuko,[  Looking at the destroyed war balloon.  ] How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?,54
Sokka,We'll figure something out! I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.,54
Zuko,You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?,54
Sokka,[  Walks to the destroyed balloon.  ] My dad might be here! I had to come and see!,54
Zuko,Uncle always said I never thought things through. But this ... this is just crazy!,54
Sokka,"[  Gathers parts from the balloon together.  ] Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place! And for the record, I  always  think things through! But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear. So there. [  After the hot water on the balloon burns his hand, Sokka kicks it into the water.  ]",54
Zuko,What are you doing?,54
Sokka,"It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it.",54
Zuko,I hope you know what you're doing. [  They both turn to look at the prison.  ] There's no turning back now.,54
Zuko,I hope these disguises work.,54
Sokka,We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible.,54
Male guard,Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard. Come on.,54
Chit Sang,I didn't do anything! I'm going back to my cell.,54
Bully guard,"[  Whips fire at him.  ] Stop right there, Chit Sang.",54
Sokka,We can't blow our cover.,54
Bully guard,I've had it with your unruly behavior!,54
Chit Sang,What did I do?,54
Bully guard,He wants to know what he did. [  To Zuko and Sokka.  ] Isn't that cute? [  Gives them a look when they say nothing.  ],54
Zuko,"Uh, very cute, sir.",54
Sokka,Super cute.,54
Bully guard,"[  Walks up to Chit Sang.  ] You didn't bow down when I walked by, Chit Sang!",54
Chit Sang,What? That's not a prison rule.,54
Bully guard,Do it!,54
Chit Sang,Make me.,54
Bully guard,"Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited. You're going in the cooler. [  Pointing at Sokka.  ] You! Help me take him in.",54
Sokka,[  Whispers to Zuko.  ] Meet back here in an hour. [  Runs up to Chit Sang and the guard.  ],54
Bully guard,The warden will deal with you soon. [  Sokka closes the doors.  ] Can you believe this guy?,54
Sokka,[  Playing along.  ] Prisoners! Am I right?,54
Bully guard,Ugh. Tell me about it.,54
Male guard,"Hey, new guy! I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times, but this is the lounge. Relax.",54
Zuko,"But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head.",54
Female guard,"Give it a week, he'll loosen up.",54
Zuko,Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?,54
Female guard,"[  Bluntly.  ] No, you can't date the female guards.",54
Male guard,"Trust me, you don't want to. [  The female guard throws a cup at him, which causes the guard sitting behind him to laugh.  ]",54
Zuko,"No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals, right? [  The other guards nod.  ] So what about war prisoners?",54
Sokka,It sure looks cold in there.,54
Bully guard,That's why we call it the cooler. He won't be firebending there. [  Notices someone coming; lowers his mask.  ] It's the warden! [  He and Sokka stand to attention.  ] Look alive!,54
Warden,"[  Opens the cooler.  ] So Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better.",54
Chit Sang,I wasn't trying to escape.,54
Bully guard,He's lying! I saw it with my own eyes. [  He is pushed aside by one of the warden's bodyguards.  ],54
Warden,"No one has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner jump in the Boiling Lake myself than let that record fall. Don't forget it. Now go back to your shivering.",54
Zuko,"Hey there, fellow guard, how goes it?",54
Sokka,[  Lifts up his helmet's visor.  ] Zuko?,54
Zuko,"Shhh! Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no Water Tribe prisoners. [  Lifts up his visor.  ] I'm afraid your father's not here.",54
Sokka,"What? Are you sure, did you double-check?",54
Zuko,"Yeah, I'm sure.",54
Sokka,No. No! [  Bangs his fists against the wall in frustration.  ],54
Zuko,"I'm really sorry, Sokka.",54
Sokka,So we came all this way for nothing? I failed ... again.,54
Zuko,"Ah, [  Holds his chin in thought.  ] what would Uncle say? [  Cut to a frog-view as he looks up at the sky.  ] Sometimes, clouds have two sides, [  Walks over to the railing.  ] a dark and light, and a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich! [  Close-up of a disinterested Sokka; voice-over.  ] So ... when life seems hard ... [  Sokka glances to the side.  ] take a bite out of the silver sandwich!",54
Sokka,Maybe we haven't failed after all!,54
Zuko,That's the spirit! [  Folds his arms.  ] I can't believe that worked. [  Looks down.  ] I didn't even know what I was saying.,54
Sokka,"No, what you said made no sense at all. But look ... [  As he points, the camera shifts to an overhead view of the yard, before rapidly zooming in on a dejected-looking Suki.  ] It's Suki!",54
Guard,"[  Voice-over.  ] Prisoners, [  Suki gets up.  ] back in your cells!",54
Suki,[  Sits up; aggressively.  ] What is it? Did I do something wrong?,54
Sokka,[  Crosses arms.  ] You mean you don't recognize me?,54
Suki,[  Close-up. She averts her eyes; bitterly.  ] You people all look the same to me.,54
Sokka,[  Frontal shot; smugly.  ] Oh? Then maybe you'll recognize this.,54
Suki,Sokka! [  Runs up to him; cut to a side-view.  ] It's you!,54
Sokka,"[  They both stand up, not releasing each other.  ] The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?",54
Suki,No. I don't know where they are. They locked me in here because I'm the leader.,54
Sokka,"[  Places his right hand on her left cheek.  ] Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out.",54
Suki,[  Frontal shot.  ] I'm so glad [  Places her hand over Sokka's on her face and closes her eyes.  ] to see you Sokka. [  Opens them again.  ] I knew you'd come.,54
Female guard,Excuse me. [  Cut to a shot from behind Zuko.  ] I need to get into that cell.,54
Zuko,"[  Shot from over the guard's shoulder.  ] No, you can't go in there! [  Looks at the prison cell; unsure.  ] The lights are out. [  Points at the door.  ] The prisoner could sneak up on you.",54
Female guard,"[  Close-up. Cut to a side-shot; annoyed.  ] Step aside, fool. [  She raises her left arm to push Zuko out of the way, though before she can touch him, he grabs hold of the arm and turns her around, slamming her face first against the door.  ] Hey, hey, what are you doing?",54
Female guard,"[  Instantly cut to a frontal shot of Sokka, who freezes over.  ] Guard, help! [  He turns to look at the struggle.  ] I think he's an impostor! [  Frontal shot of Sokka, looking unsure.  ] Arrest him!",54
Female guard,Get him off me and arrest him!,54
Sokka,"[  Grabs Zuko and throws him down on the floor.  ] You're under arrest! [  Whispering.  ] Don't worry, I'll figure it out.",54
Warden,"Well, well, well. I never thought I'd find you in here, [  Smiles evilly and walks into the cell.  ] Prince Zuko.",54
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ] How did you know who I am?,54
Warden,How could I not? You broke my niece's heart.,54
Zuko,[  Even more shocked.  ] You're Mai's uncle? I never meant to hurt her.,54
Warden,"Quiet! You're my special prisoner now. And you'd best behave. If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down, why they'd tear you to shreds.",54
Zuko,[  Folds his arms.  ] So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my father to come collect a reward?,54
Warden,"Oh, in due time, believe me, I intend to collect. [  Walks away and shuts the door.  ]",54
Sokka,"Oh, good, you guys have met.",54
Suki,"Actually, we met a long time ago.",54
Zuko,We did?,54
Suki,"[  Somewhat angrily.  ] Yeah, you kind of burned down my village.",54
Zuko,"[  Stops mopping for a second.  ] Oh, sorry about that. Nice to see you again.",54
Sokka,"So, listen, I think I have an escape plan. I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?",54
Zuko,Yeah ...,54
Sokka,"So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right?",54
Suki,"Just get to the point, Sokka.",54
Sokka,It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water.,54
Zuko,[  Exchanges a worried glance with Suki.  ] The cooler as a boat? Are you sure?,54
Sokka,"I'm telling you, it'll work. [  Flashes back to Sokka walking around the island; voice-over.  ] I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. [  Sokka puts a miniature boat in the water and watching it float away.  ] I already tested it out. We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound, no one will notice. [  Fade back to Sokka talking to Zuko and Suki.  ] And bing-bang-boom, we're home free.",54
Suki,But how are you going to get the cooler out?,54
Chit Sang,"[  From the staircase.  ] Yeah, how are you going to get the cooler out? [  Jumps down.  ]",54
Sokka,[  Covering up.  ] What? We didn't ... w-we didn't say that.,54
Zuko,"Yeah, you heard wrong.",54
Chit Sang,"I heard you hatching an escape plan, and I want in.",54
Zuko,There's nothing to get in on.,54
Sokka,"Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg?",54
Chit Sang,"[  Unconvinced.  ] Okay, well, I come with you or the warden [  Camera pans from a serious-looking Zuko to Suki.  ] hears about this egg, too.",54
Suki,[  To Sokka.  ] I guess we have no choice.,54
Sokka,"Okay, you're in. [  Handing Zuko a wrench.  ] Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside.",54
Chit Sang,"Oh, I can get you inside.",54
Chit Sang,"Hey! What are you, stupid? Watch where you're going! [  Shoves Zuko.  ]",54
Zuko,"Hey, you watch who you're shoving! [  He pushes Chit Sang.  ]",54
Chit Sang,I think you mean  whom  I'm shoving!,54
Sokka,[  Approaching. Yelling.  ] I need backup over here!,54
Male guard,No firebending! [  Pointing.  ] Into the cooler!,54
Sokka,I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.,54
Zuko,"[  Raises his head slightly and releases a small breath of fire to warm himself up.  ] Yes, I have ... completely. [  Reveals all the removed bolts and screws, which makes Sokka smile.  ]",54
Sokka,[  Lifts his visor; whispering.  ] I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore.,54
Zuko,Someone's coming! [  Takes Sokka into the cooler and closes the door.  ],54
Male guard,"Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn.",54
Female guard,Anybody interesting?,54
Male guard,"Nah, just the usual. Some robbers, a couple traitors, some war prisoners, [  Sokka looks at Zuko with shock and worry.  ] though I did hear there might be a pirate.",54
Female guard,No fooling!,54
Zuko,War prisoners. It could be your father.,54
Sokka,I know.,54
Zuko,"Well, what should we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?",54
Sokka,"I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?",54
Zuko,"It's your call, Sokka.",54
Chit Sang,"Took you guys long enough. [  Cut briefly to two other prisoners, a male sitting on a rock, and a female waving.  ] This here's my girl and my best buddy, they're coming too.",54
Sokka,Fine. Everybody in the cooler. Let's go. [  They move the cooler into the water. Cut to Sokka lifting a rock hiding his Water Tribe outfit.  ],54
Zuko,Are you sure you wanna go? You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your dad is your chance.,54
Suki,[  Approaching.  ] Your dad?,54
Sokka,"[  Turns to Zuko.  ] If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.",54
Zuko,"No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.",54
Sokka,[  Standing.  ] That supposed to make me feel better?,54
Zuko,[  Sokka moves away.  ] Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again ...,54
Sokka,"Seriously, not helping.",54
Zuko,[  Grabs Sokka's shoulder.  ] You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you  might  fail.,54
Chit Sang,"[  Standing by the cooler boat.  ] Hey, if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on?",54
Sokka,No. I'm staying. You guys go. [  To Suki.  ] You've been here long enough.,54
Suki,"I'm not leaving without you, Sokka.",54
Zuko,"I'm staying, too.",54
Chit Sang,"Not me, I'm out. Let's roll, baby. [  Pushes the cooler into the lake and jumps in.  ]",54
Sokka,We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.,54
Chit Sang,"Aah, this current is so slow. I can use this to paddle. [  Rips off a piece of the cooler. When he puts the piece of metal in the water, the steaming water splashes on to his hand, causing him to scream loudly.  ]",54
Warden,Guards! Secure the perimeter and lock down the prisoners! Now!,54
Sokka,The plan failed! They're caught!,54
Warden,Get the fugitives and throw them in the cooler!,54
Male guard #2,"[  The guard in charge of the steering wheel turns toward the warden.  ] Uh ... they are in a cooler, sir.",54
Warden,One that's bolted down and not floating in the water! This is a lockdown! We have new prisoners arriving! Everything must be completely secure!,54
Sokka,"The gondola's moving. [  Cut to a side-view of the gondola approaching the prison. Cut to a view of the prison yard as the gondola nears its stop. Cut to Sokka and Suki now in the yard.  ] This is it. [  Cut to the gondola arriving. Cut to Sokka, Zuko and Suki in the yard.  ] If my dad's not there, we've risked everything for nothing.",54
Suki,We had to. [  Holds Sokka's hand.  ],54
Sokka,"Come on, come on ...",54
Zuko,Is that him? [  Cut to Sokka.  ],54
Sokka,My dad doesn't have a nose ring. [  Cut briefly to the gondola as several men step off.  ] Where is he? [  Cut to the gondola briefly as we see one more prisoner exit. Hakoda does not appear.  ] That's it? That can't be it.,54
Suki,"[  Comforting.  ] I'm sorry, Sokka.",54
Sokka,"Oh, no.",54
Male guard,"Hey, you! Get off the gondola!",54
Sokka,"[  Cut to Sokka, Shocked.  ] Dad ...",54
Bodyguard,Line 'em up for the warden!,55
Sokka,"Dad ... [  Exiting a stairway and passing through a lineup of guards, surprising them a bit.  ] Excuse me, coming through. The warden wants me over there. [  Points in the warden's direction.  ] Sorry!",55
Warden,"[  Walking past the line of prisoners starting from the left.  ] Welcome to the Boiling Rock. I'm sure you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island. Well, I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true, as long as you do everything I say. [  He stops in front of Hakoda who looks downward; looks closer at Hakoda.  ] Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you.",55
Hakoda,[  Averting his gaze slightly off to the side; firmly.  ] No.,55
Warden,Oh? You'd rather look at my shoes? [  Angrily.  ] Then take a look!,55
Warden,"I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong-willed. [  Cut to the warden's face.  ] But don't worry, we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye!",55
Warden,"[  Calmer.  ] See, isn't that better? [  To the other prisoners.  ] You will all do as I say or pay the price. You will all-",55
Bogyguard #2,"[  Standing over him.  ] Are you okay, sir?",55
Warden,[  Rises and snaps angrily.  ] I'm fine! Get these prisoners out of my sight!,55
Sokka,[  Approaches his father.  ] Thank goodness you're okay.,55
Hakoda,"[  Rises to his feet and extends his right arm out, clenched in a fist, not realizing the guard is his son in disguise; Sokka backs up a bit.  ] If you take one step closer, you'll see just how ""okay"" I am.",55
Sokka,"[  Lifting up his helmet mask.  ] Dad, it's me.",55
Hakoda,"[  Softens up and grows teary-eyed.  ] Sokka, [  The two embrace; Sokka drops his helmet to the floor.  ] my son. [  Amused.  ] You know Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut.",55
Sokka,"[  Rubs the back of his neck sheepishly.  ] Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier.",55
Warden,"[  Calmly.  ] Are you comfortable, Chit Sang?",55
Chit Sang,"[  Snaps.  ] If you're trying to get me to talk, forget it! [  The warden appears behind him.  ] I'm not a squealer!",55
Warden,"[  Cuts to close-up of his face; casually.  ] Chit Sang, I only asked if you were comfortable.",55
Chit Sang,"[  Brightly.  ] Well, yeah, actually I am pretty comfortable.",55
Warden,Are you still comfortable?,55
Chit Sang,No.,55
Warden,I know you and your cronies are not smart enough to come up with that little escape plan. So you're gonna tell me ... [  Leans in closer to Chit Sang.  ] who is?,55
Sokka,[  To Hakoda.  ] So where's Bato? [  Cut to inside the prison cell; Sokka turns away from the door.  ] Where's everyone else from the invasion?,55
Hakoda,"The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here. [  Sokka comes by his father and sits down.  ] But before I left, I met some young women who said they knew you. The ... Oshinama Fighters?",55
Sokka,[  Smiles.  ] You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?,55
Hakoda,That's right.,55
Sokka,Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us.,55
Hakoda,[  Lays a hand on Sokka's shoulder.  ] Good. We'll need all the help we can get.,55
Sokka,And you know Prince Zuko?,55
Hakoda,"The son of the Fire Lord? I don't know him, but I know of him.",55
Sokka,"Well, he's here too.",55
Hakoda,[  Crosses his arms angrily.  ] Sounds like a major problem.,55
Sokka,"Actually, he's on our side now. [  Cut to Hakoda, who gives his son a suspicious look.  ] I know. I had the same reaction. After all he's done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help. [  Hakoda nods his head at Sokka, indicating that he understands.  ]",55
Hakoda,"So, do you have a plan?",55
Sokka,"[  Downcast.  ] We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it. [  Leans forward and rests his face in his arms.  ] I dunno if there's another way off this island.",55
Hakoda,"[  Smiles and pats a hand on Sokka's back.  ] Sokka, there's no prison in the world that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.",55
Sokka,Then we'd better find two.,55
Sokka,"[  In a hushed voice.  ] Zuko, are you there?",55
Zuko,[  A view of Zuko's eyes appears in the slit from inside the cell.  ] I'm here.,55
Sokka,I just got done talking to my dad. We came up with an escape plan together.,55
Male guard,[  Off-camera; startles Sokka.  ] What are you doing here?,55
Sokka,[  Pointing to the cell and trying to act gruff.  ] I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!,55
Male guard,"Well, you'll have to do that later. He's coming with us.",55
Sokka,[  Puzzled.  ] Why?,55
Female guard,"[  Irritated.  ] Because we have orders straight from the warden, that's why!",55
Sokka,Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit? [  Punches his palm with his fist.  ],55
Female guard,"Fine, ten seconds.",55
Sokka,[  Off-camera from inside the cell.  ] Take that ... and this! [  Punching noises come from the cell.  ],55
Male guard,[  Amused.  ] Newbie.,55
Sokka,"[  In a hushed voice while still punching the mattress.  ] We have a new plan, but it's gonna need a big distraction. [  Cuts to shot of Zuko who peers from behind the blanket; off camera.  ] Be in the yard in one hour.",55
Male guard,"[  Separates the two.  ] All right, that's enough.",55
Zuko,[  Voice-over.  ] What are you doing? Where are you taking me? [  He is thrown into a chair in an interrogation room.  ] I didn't do anything wrong!,55
Mai,"Come on, [  Zuko looks to the source of the voice.  ] Zuko. [  Emerges from the corner of the room; annoyed.  ] We all know that's a lie.",55
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ] Mai!,55
Warden,How is he?,55
Bodyguard #2,I think he's ready to talk.,55
Warden,[  Approaches him from behind.  ] Have you had enough time to think about what I asked?,55
Chit Sang,Yes.,55
Warden,[  Eager.  ] And?,55
Chit Sang,You're right. There was another person involved in the escape plan.,55
Warden,[  Places his hand on Chit Sang's shoulder.  ] Who?,55
Chit Sang,It's a guy who's disguised like a prison guard. Only he's not a prison guard. He's the mastermind. He came up with the plan.,55
Zuko,How did you know I was here?,55
Mai,Because I know you so well.,55
Zuko,"But, how-",55
Mai,"The warden's my uncle, you idiot. [  Zuko facepalms and sighs; Mai shows him a letter.  ] The truth is, I guess I don't know you. All I get is a letter? You could have least looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart.",55
Zuko,I didn't mean to -,55
Mai,"You didn't mean to? [  Reading the letter.  ] ""Dear Mai, I'm sorry you that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving.""",55
Zuko,Stop! This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation!,55
Mai,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Thanks Zuko, that makes me feel all better. [  Throws the letter at him.  ]",55
Zuko,"[  Stands up.  ] Mai, I never wanted to hurt you. But I have to do this to save my country.",55
Mai,Save it? You're betraying your country!,55
Zuko,That's not how I see it.,55
Suki,"Sokka, what's going on?",55
Sokka,[  Places his hand on her shoulder.  ] I don't have much time. If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up. [  Walks over to the door and peers outside.  ] I just talked to my dad.,55
Suki,That's great.,55
Sokka,"Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola.",55
Suki,What?,55
Sokka,My dad and I came up with the plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola [  Puts both hands on her shoulders.  ] and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.,55
Suki,[  Takes his hands off her shoulders.  ] We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards.,55
Sokka,My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.,55
Suki,"Okay, let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive.",55
Sokka,"Not if the warden  is  the captive. [  Nearby noise occurs. Moves to look outside.  ] I have to go. [  Suki hugs him.  ] I'll find you before we start the riot. [  Cut to outside the cell, where he slides out of the cell.  ]",55
Male guard,"Hey, you, the warden wants to see you!",55
Sokka,Why?,55
Male guard,"I don't know, I didn't ask.",55
Sokka,Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow? [  Walks off-screen.  ],55
Male guard,He wants to see you ... now. [  Sokka is escorted by two guards.  ],55
Warden,Put him in the line-up.,55
Warden,"One of you is an impostor who thought he could fool me. [  Chit Sang steps forward.  ] But now, that person is going to be in a lot of trouble. Who is it?",55
Chit Sang,"[  Off-screen.  ] That's him, warden. He's the impostor! [  The camera shifts to Chit Sang, who is pointing at the bully guard.  ]",55
Bully guard,What?,55
Bully guard,[  Grabs Chit Sang by the shirt.  ] I am not! [  Chit Sang just raises his hands nonchalantly in defense.  ] He's lying! [  Another guard grabs him.  ] He's a liar!,55
Bully guard,I'm telling you ... it wasn't me!,55
Warden,Save your breath! I know you were working together. [  Turns around and moves in closer to the guard.  ] You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan.,55
Bully guard,That was just a coincidence!,55
Bodyguard #2,"Sir, there's someone to see you.",55
Warden,[  Angrily.  ] Who told you to interrupt me?,55
Azula,I  did.,55
Warden,[  Cut closer to Azula.  ] Princess Azula. [  Azula and Ty Lee walk in.  ] Ah ... It is an honor to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison. [  Stands up.  ] I didn't realize you were coming.,55
Azula,[  Walks in and notices the guard sitting in the chair.  ] Who is this?,55
Warden,"[  Cut to the bully guard, who looks away.  ] He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt.",55
Bully guard,[  Desperately.  ] It wasn't me!,55
Warden,"[  Angrily.  ] Quiet, you!",55
Azula,[  Crossing her arms.  ] You're wasting your time. That's not one of them. [  Turns and starts to leave.  ],55
Warden,How do you know?,55
Azula,[  Smiles sinisterly; quietly.  ] Because I'm a people person. [  Exits.  ],55
Sokka,"Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard.",55
Door guard,But we're in the middle of a lockdown.,55
Sokka,"Oh, okay, I'll just go tell the warden you said that. [  Walks off-screen; the guard raises his mask and looks at him speechless.  ] I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority. [  Guard grows more nervous. Walks back on-screen, lifting his helmet mask.  ] What's your name again?",55
Door guard,[  Starts to sweat; horrified.  ] Wait! Don't tell the warden. I'm just a little confused.,55
Sokka,"Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says. [  Places his arm around the guard's shoulder.  ]",55
Door guard,Yeah ... you're right. We're letting them out!,55
Sokka,This is it! We have to start a riot.,55
Suki,Okay. But how do we do that?,55
Hakoda,[  Smiles smugly.  ] I'll show you. [  Shoves a prisoner.  ],55
Tough prisoner,Hey! What'd you do that for? That hurt my feelings.,55
Hakoda,Aren't you mad at me?,55
Tough prisoner,"Uh, well, normally I would be, but I've been learning to control my anger.",55
Sokka,This isn't working.,55
Chit Sang,"Hey you! You're lucky I didn't rat you out, [  Smiles.  ] but my generosity comes with a price. I know you're planning another escape attempt, and I want in.",55
Sokka,"[  Gets an idea.  ] Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot. [  Points to him.  ] You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you?",55
Chit Sang,"A prison riot? Please. [  Grabs a prisoner and lifts him in the air, bouncing him up and down.  ] Hey! [  All the prisoners look at him.  ] Riot!",55
Hakoda,[  Looks shocked for a moment.  ] Impressive.,55
Tough prisoner,"Forget about controlling my anger ... [  Raises his arms.  ] let's riot! [  He is taken down by another prisoner. The riot is in full swing. Cut the floor of the yard as chaos and dust ensues everywhere. Cut to a prisoner sitting on another prisoner's shoulders, attempting to choke him. Cut to the bottom of a tower as various guards look down at the scene.  ]",55
Warden,Who let these prisoners into the yard? [  Cut to the warden on a balcony.  ] This is supposed to be a lockdown!,55
Male guard #2,"Ma'am, there's a riot going on! I'm here to protect you!",55
Mai,I don't need any protection.,55
Zuko,"[  Gives a slight chuckle; proudly.  ] Believe me, she doesn't.",55
Male guard #2,"I'm sorry, but I'm under direct orders from your uncle to make sure nothing happens. [  Zuko gives a serious look.  ]",55
Mai,Get off of me! [  She throws the guard away from her and chases Zuko.  ],55
Sokka,"Zuko! Good, we're all here. Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas!",55
Zuko,And how do we do that?,55
Sokka,I'm not sure.,55
Zuko,[  Groans.  ] I thought you thought this through!,55
Sokka,I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!,55
Zuko,"Maybe not everything, but this is kind of important! [  Rubs his forehead.  ]",55
Chit Sang,"Hey, uh, fellas. I think your girlfriend's taking care of it.",55
Warden,You wouldn't dare.,55
Suki,"[  Ties his hands together and uses his headband as a gag.  ] Sorry, warden. You're  my  prisoner now. [  Slams the warden against the wall; the rest of the escapees arrive.  ] We've got the warden! Now let's get out of here!",55
Hakoda,That's some girl.,55
Sokka,[  Proudly.  ] Tell me about it.,55
Suki,We're almost there!,55
Zuko,"Back off! We've got the warden! [  The guards see the warden on Chit Sang's shoulder, bound and gagged, and clear the way.  ] Let's go!",55
Suki,Everyone in!,55
Sokka,What are you doing?,55
Zuko,I'm making it so they can't stop us.,55
Sokka,Way to think ahead.,55
Suki,We're on our way!,55
Hakoda,Wait! Who's that?,55
Zuko,That's a problem. It's my sister and her friend.,55
Suki,[  Determined.  ] This is a rematch I've been waiting for.,55
Zuko,Me too.,55
Gondola guard,There's the warden! I see him!,55
Warden,[  Frees himself and runs to look out of the gondola.  ] Cut the line! [  Chit Sang notices and grabs the warden.  ],55
Gondola guard,He wants us to cut the line.,55
Gondola guard #2,"But if we cut the line, there's no way he'll survive!",55
Gondola guard,[  Puts down his telescope.  ] He knows that.,55
Ty Lee,They're about to cut the line!,55
Azula,"[  Smirks.  ] Then it's time to leave. [  Blasts herself up.  ] Goodbye, Zuko. [  Reaches the other gondola.  ]",55
Zuko,They're cutting the line! The gondola's about to go!,55
Hakoda,I hope this thing floats.,55
Gondola guard #3,What are you doing?,55
Mai,Saving the jerk who dumped me.,55
Sokka,Who's that?,55
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ] It's Mai!,55
Azula,[  Angrily.  ] What is she doing?,55
Hakoda,"Sorry, warden. Your record is officially  broken  . [  The warden struggles against his bindings.  ]",55
Suki,"Well, we made it out. Now what?",55
Sokka,"Zuko, what are you doing?",55
Zuko,My sister was on that island.,55
Sokka,"Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop!",55
Zuko,What I mean is she must have come here somehow. [  Walks up to a large hill by the sea.  ] There! [  Pan down to a large airship.  ] That's our way out of here!,55
Azula,"Leave us alone. [  The guards give the Fire Nation salute and exit. Mai raises her head a little, looking defiant.  ] I never expected this from you. [  Cut to a side view of Mai, followed by a frontal shot of Ty Lee, who looks from one to the other, tears in her eyes, and back to Azula.  ] The thing I don't understand is ""Why?"". Why would you do it? You know the consequences.",55
Mai,I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated. I love Zuko more than I fear you.,55
Azula,"[  Her intrigued expression contorts into one of absolute rage.  ] No,  you  miscalculated! You should have feared me more!",55
Ty Lee,"[  Runs to a shocked Mai, shaking her from her stupor.  ] Come on! Let's get out of here!",55
Azula,[  Still on the ground; angrily.  ] You're both fools!,55
Gondola guard #4,"What shall we do with them, princess?",55
Azula,"Put them somewhere I'll never have to see their faces again, and let them rot!",55
Katara,What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon?,55
Zuko,It kind of got destroyed.,55
Aang,Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.,55
Toph,Did you at least get some good meat?,55
Sokka,I did. The best meat of all. The meat of friendship and fatherhood.,55
Chit Sang,"[  Waving.  ] I'm new. What's up, everybody?",55
Katara,[  Tearing up; overjoyed.  ] Dad? [  Runs to him.  ],55
Hakoda,"Hi, Katara. [  They embrace.  ]",55
Katara,How are you here? What is going on? Where did you go?,55
Sokka,We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.,55
Toph,Seriously? You guys didn't find  any  meat?,55
Zuko,[  As he runs and pushes her out of harm's way.  ] Watch out!,56
Katara,[  Angrily.  ] What are you doing?,56
Zuko,[  Calmly.  ] Keeping rocks from crushing you.,56
Katara,"Okay, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now!",56
Zuko,I'll take that as a thank you. [  Rises.  ],56
Toph,[  Pointing to the exit.  ] Come on! We can get out through here!,56
Aang,[  To Zuko.  ] What are you doing?,56
Zuko,Go ahead! I'll hold them off. I think this is a family visit. [  Runs off.  ],56
Aang,"[  In the background, Sokka and Katara run up to him.  ] Zuko! No!",56
Sokka,Come on! We've gotta get out of here!,56
Zuko,What are you doing here?,56
Azula,[  Smiling.  ] You mean it's not obvious yet? I am about to celebrate becoming an only child!,56
Aang,I can't get him to go in there! Appa hates tunnels!,56
Katara,"Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here.",56
Aang,We'll have to find a way!,56
Sokka,We need to split up. [  To the others.  ] Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.,56
Katara,[  Turns around and suddenly grows angry.  ] No! [  Walks up to her father.  ] The Fire Nation can't separate our family again!,56
Hakoda,It'll be okay. It's not forever.,56
Toph,I can clear that away and we can fly out through there!,56
Suki,"Um, there's an awful lot of fire in that general direction ...",56
Aang,We'll get through. Let's go.,56
Zuko,"She's ... not gonna make it ... [  Azula uses her firebending to propel herself toward the wall, stopping her fall with her hair pin and saving herself.  ] Of course she did.",56
Aang,"Wow, camping ... it really seems like old times again, doesn't it?",56
Zuko,"[  Jokingly.  ] If you really want it to feel like old times, I could, uh ... chase you around a while and try to capture you. [  He smiles and the rest of the group laughs, except for Katara.  ]",56
Katara,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Ha, ha.",56
Sokka,"[  Holding up his cup.  ] To Zuko! Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero?",56
Team Avatar,"[  Everybody except Katara holds up their cups.  ] Hear! Hear! [  Aang nudges him with his elbow, before Toph lightly punches him.  ]",56
Zuko,[  Smiling.  ] I'm touched. [  Stops smiling.  ] I don't deserve this.,56
Katara,"[  Angrily.  ] Yeah, no kidding. [  Walks away.  ]",56
Sokka,What's with her?,56
Zuko,I wish I knew. [  Follows her.  ],56
Sokka,[  Voice-over.  ] What's with him?,56
Zuko,This isn't fair! Everyone else seems to trust me now! What is it with you?,56
Katara,"[  Turns around; furiously.  ] Oh, everyone trusts you now! I was the first person to trust you! [  Places her left hand on her heart.  ] Remember, back in Ba Sing Se. [  Points to the ocean.  ] And you turned around and betrayed me, betrayed all of us!",56
Zuko,[  Closes eyes in resentment.  ] What can I do to make it up to you?,56
Katara,"[  Cuts to shot of her and Zuko standing on the cliff as she approaches him while snapping at him angrily.  ] You really want to know? Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. [  Cuts to side-view of her and Zuko.  ] Or, I know! You could bring my mother back!",56
Suki,"[  Embarrassed.  ] Oops, wrong tent!",56
Zuko,"Sorry, do you need to talk to Sokka, too?",56
Suki,"Nope, not me! [  Walks away.  ]",56
Sokka,"[  Holding a rose in his mouth, surrounded by lit candles.  ] Well, hello ... [  Surprised to find Zuko in his tent, destroying the rose in his mouth.  ] Uh, Zuko! Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different? [  Painfully swallows rose petals and thorns.  ] So what's on your mind?",56
Zuko,"Your sister. She hates me! And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of me.",56
Sokka,"Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't  hate  anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. [  His eyes widen as he realizes his mistake.  ] No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!",56
Zuko,"[  Interrupting him.  ] Stop. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of nowhere, but I want you to tell me what happened to your mother.",56
Sokka,[  Slightly taken aback.  ] What? Why would you want to know that?,56
Zuko,"Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se, and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow she's connected her anger at that to her anger at me.",56
Sokka,[  Sadly.  ] It's not a day I like to remember.,56
Young Katara,I'm going to find Mom! [  Runs off.  ],56
Sokka,"[  Voice-over.  ] Many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant: a Fire Nation raid. [  A battle scene is depicted of Water Tribe Warriors and Fire Nation soldiers charging and attacking one another.  ] We were badly outnumbered, but somehow, we managed to drive them off. As quickly as they came, they just left.",56
Sokka,"I was so relieved when it was over, but that's because I didn't know yet what had happened. I didn't know we had lost our mother.",56
Zuko,Wait. Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village? Like what the lead ship looked like?,56
Sokka,"Yeah ... sea ravens. [  Scene shows flashback of three red flags waving in the breeze, bearing sea ravens.  ] The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them.",56
Zuko,"The symbol of the Southern Raiders. Thanks, Sokka.",56
Sokka,[  Urging Zuko hurriedly out of the tent.  ] No problem. Thanks for stopping by! [  Zuko leaves.  ] I'd thought he'd never leave. [  Peaks head out excitedly and whispers.  ] Suki!,56
Katara,[  Angrily.  ] You look terrible.,56
Zuko,I waited out here all night.,56
Katara,[  Brushing her hair.  ] What do you want?,56
Zuko,"I know who killed your mother, [  She abruptly stops.  ] and I'm going to help you find him.",56
Katara,I need to borrow Appa.,56
Aang,[  Jokingly.  ] Why? Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?,56
Katara,"Yes, it is.",56
Aang,[  Slightly surprised.  ] Oh. What's going on?,56
Katara,We're going to find the man who took my mother from me.,56
Zuko,Sokka told me the story of what happened. I know who did it and I know how to find him.,56
Aang,Um ... and what exactly do you think this will accomplish?,56
Katara,"[  Shakes her head in dismay.  ] Ugh, I knew you wouldn't understand. [  Begins to walk away.  ]",56
Aang,Wait! Stop! I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?,56
Zuko,"She needs this, Aang. This is about getting closure and justice.",56
Aang,I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge.,56
Katara,"[  Angrily.  ] Fine, maybe it is! Maybe that's what I need! Maybe that's what he deserves!",56
Aang,"Katara, you sound like Jet.",56
Katara,"It's not the same! Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster.",56
Sokka,"Katara, she was my mother, too, but I think Aang might be right.",56
Katara,Then you didn't love her the way I did!,56
Sokka,[  Hurt.  ] Katara!,56
Aang,"The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.",56
Zuko,"That's cute, but this isn't air temple preschool. It's the real world.",56
Katara,"Now that I know he's out there ... now that I know we can find him, I feel like I have no choice.",56
Aang,"Katara, you do have a choice: forgiveness.",56
Zuko,That's the same as doing nothing!,56
Aang,"No, it's not. It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive.",56
Katara,"It's not just hard, it's impossible. [  Cuts to overhead shot of the field as she walks away, Zuko following behind.  ]",56
Aang,So you were just gonna take Appa anyway?,56
Katara,Yes.,56
Aang,"It's okay, because I forgive you. [  Pauses.  ] That give you any ideas?",56
Katara,Don't try to stop us.,56
Aang,"I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. [  Katara situates herself on Appa's head.  ] But when you do, please don't choose revenge. Let your anger out, and then let it go. Forgive him.",56
Zuko,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Okay, we'll be sure to do that, guru goody-goody. [  Climbs aboard Appa.  ]",56
Katara,"Thanks for understanding, Aang. Yip-yip. [  Appa takes flight; Aang and Sokka look up at the departing bison, their backs facing the camera.  ]",56
Sokka,"You know, you're pretty wise for a kid.",56
Aang,"Thanks, Sokka.",56
Sokka,"[  Cuts to shot of the two standing together looking up.  ] Usually it's annoying, but right now, I'm impressed.",56
Aang,I appreciate that.,56
Sokka,"So, can I borrow Momo for a week?",56
Aang,[  Surprised.  ] Why do you need Momo?,56
Zuko,We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower. All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk. And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed.,56
Katara,"[  Cuts to shot of the communication tower situated on an island in the middle of the ocean; off-camera.  ] So once we find the communication tower, we bust in and take the information we need.",56
Zuko,"[  Voice-over.  ] Not exactly. We need to be stealthy and make sure no one spots us, [  Cuts to shot of the communication tower, the camera panning downward.  ] otherwise they'll warn the Southern Raiders long before we reach them.",56
Zuko,"Okay, Southern Raiders. [  Opens a scroll.  ] Bam. [  Points to location on map; off-camera.  ] On patrol near Whaletail Island.",56
Katara,"[  Cuts to shot of Zuko and Katara looking at the map.  ] Whaletail Island, here we come.",56
Zuko,You should get some rest. We'll be there in a few hours. You'll need all your strength.,56
Katara,"Oh, don't you worry about my strength. I have plenty. I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came.",56
Young Katara,I'm going to find Mom.,56
Young Katara,Mom!,56
Kya,Just let her go and I'll give you the information you want.,56
Yon Rha,You heard your mother. Get out of here!,56
Young Katara,"Mom, I'm scared.",56
Kya,"Go find your dad, sweetie. I'll handle this.",56
Katara,[  Voice-over.  ] I ran as fast as I could.,56
Young Katara,"[  Arrives to where her father is battling Fire Nation soldiers.  ] Dad, Dad! Please, I think Mom's in trouble! There's a man in our house!",56
Hakoda,Kya!,56
Katara,"But we were too late. When we got there, the man was gone. [  Voice begins breaking.  ] And so was she.",56
Zuko,Your mother was a brave woman.,56
Katara,[  Clutches her necklace.  ] I know.,56
Zuko,There! [  Katara looks up.  ] See those sea raven flags? [  Tosses the telescope to Katara.  ] It's the Southern Raiders.,56
Katara,[  Determined.  ] Let's do this.,56
Soldier,"So there I was, and I was like, 'You know ...'",56
Zuko,"This is it, Katara. Are you ready to face him?",56
Southern Raiders commander,Who are you?,56
Zuko,"You don't remember her? You will soon, trust me.",56
Southern Raiders commander,What's ... [  He attempts to control his arm which bends about uncontrollably.  ] happening to me?,56
Zuko,Think back. Think back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe.,56
Southern Raiders commander,"[  Helplessly subdued.  ] I don't know what you're talking about. Please, I don't know!",56
Zuko,[  Bending down closer to the commander.  ] Don't lie! You look her in the eye and you tell me you don't remember what you did.,56
Katara,It's not him. [  She frees him from her grip.  ] He's not the man.,56
Zuko,What? What do you mean he's not? He's the leader of the Southern Raiders! He has to be the guy!,56
Zuko,"If you're not the man we're looking for, who is?",56
Southern Raiders commander,You must be looking for Yon Rha. He retired four years ago.,56
Yon Rha's mother,"Yon Rha! You lazy piece of work, I need something.",56
Yon Rha,"[  Stops his work and attempts to placate.  ] Yes, Mother. What is it?",56
Yon Rha's mother,The tomato-carrots from your garden are too hard for my gums. I need something soft and juicy!,56
Yon Rha,Would you like something else from the garden? I would be happy to ...,56
Yon Rha's mother,[  Angrily. Her fists clench as she interrupts.  ] Forget your stupid garden! [  Cut to a close-up of her as she yells at him; irritatingly.  ] Get your grimy hind to the market and buy me some real food!,56
Yon Rha,[  Suspiciously.  ] Hello? [  To stand owner.  ] Did you see someone?,56
Yon Rha,Hello? [  Camera view shifts to show someone hiding.  ] Is someone there?,56
Katara,That was him. That was the monster.,56
Yon Rha,Nobody sneaks up on me without getting burned! [  Drops basket of vegetables and firebends at a nearby bush.  ],56
Zuko,We weren't behind the bush. [  Cut to a side view of the confrontation as Zuko takes a step forward to threaten Yon Rha.  ] And I wouldn't try firebending again!,56
Yon Rha,"[  Cut to Yon Rha on the ground with his arm shielding his face. Frightened.  ] Whoever you are, take my money. Take whatever you want. I'll cooperate.",56
Katara,Do you know who I am?,56
Yon Rha,No. I'm not sure.,56
Katara,"Oh, you better remember me like your life depends on it! Why don't you take a closer look? [  Camera focuses on front view of her face.  ]",56
Yon Rha,"[  Camera focuses on him.  ] Yes, yes, I remember you now. [  Focuses on Katara again.  ] You're that little Water Tribe girl.",56
Kya,Just let her go and [  Camera zooms out to show Kya kneeling on the floor in front of Yon Rha.  ] I'll give you the information you want.,56
Yon Rha,You heard your mother. Get out of here!,56
Young Katara,"[  Holds her hands together.  ] Mom, I'm scared.",56
Kya,"Go find your dad, sweetie. I'll handle this.",56
Yon Rha,"Now tell me, who is it? Who's the waterbender?",56
Kya,There are no waterbenders here. The Fire Nation took them all away a long time ago.,56
Yon Rha,You're lying. My source says there's one waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe. We're not leaving until we find the waterbender!,56
Kya,"If I tell you, do you promise [  She lowers her head and closes her eyes to make a decision.  ] to leave the rest of the village alone? [  Cut to a side view of Yon Rha who nods.  ] It's me. [  Cut to Kya who looks up.  ] Take me as your prisoner.",56
Yon Rha,[  Cut to a close-up of Yon Rha who smiles evilly.  ] I'm afraid I'm not taking prisoners today ...,56
Katara,She lied to you! [  Cut to a close-up of Katara who turns away from Yon Rha as she closes her eyes sadly.  ] She was protecting the last waterbender!,56
Yon Rha,[  Shocked.  ] What? Who?,56
Katara,[  Cut back to Katara who turns to face him again as she opens her eyes and looks back furiously.  ] Me!,56
Yon Rha,"[  Falls to his knees.  ] I did a bad thing! I know I did and you deserve revenge, so why don't you take  my  mother? That would be fair! [  Attempts to smile weakly.  ]",56
Katara,"[  Sorrowfully.  ] I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand. There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty.",56
Yon Rha,"[  Humbly.  ] Please, spare me! [  Cries.  ]",56
Katara,But as much as I hate you ... I just can't do it.,56
Aang,Katara? Are you okay?,56
Katara,I'm doing fine.,56
Aang,"Zuko told me what you did. Or what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you.",56
Katara,"I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him, but I couldn't. I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or because I'm strong enough not to.",56
Aang,You did the right thing. Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing.,56
Katara,[  Rises from boardwalk.  ] But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him. [  Smiles at Zuko and walks up to him.  ] But I am ready to forgive you.,56
Zuko,You were right about what Katara needed. Violence wasn't the answer.,56
Aang,It never is.,56
Zuko,Then I have a question for you. [  Turns to look at him.  ] What are you gonna do when you face my father?,56
Katara,Doesn't it seem kind of weird that we're hiding from the Fire Lord in his own house?,57
Zuko,"I told you, [  Cut to Zuko sitting on a dry fountain and wiping his head with a cloth.  ] my father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy. And that was a long time ago. It's the last place anyone would think to look for us.",57
Sokka,You guys are not gonna believe this! There's a play about us.,57
Suki,"[  Cut to close-up of her and Sokka.  ] We were just in town and we found this poster! [  Sokka shows the poster for the play to the team. It depicts Katara, Aang, and Sokka with Zuko's scarred face in the background.  ]",57
Katara,What? How is that possible?,57
Sokka,"Listen to this ... [  Turns the poster toward him.  ] ""  The Boy in the Iceberg  is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu-on Tim, [  Cut to a close shot of the poster as the camera pans up.  ] who scoured the globe gathering information on the Avatar, from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se. [  Shot changes to show Team Avatar.  ] His sources include singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war, and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage.""",57
Suki,"""Brought to you by the critically acclaimed Ember Island Players.""",57
Zuko,[  Recalling a memory.  ] Ugh! My mother used to take us to see them. They butchered  Love Amongst the Dragons  every year!,57
Katara,"Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?",57
Sokka,"[  Persuasively.  ] Come on, a day at the theater? This is the kind of wacky time-wasting nonsense I've been missing! [  He holds up the poster anxiously and smiles sheepishly; Katara looks away, appears nonplussed.  ]",57
Aang,"[  To Zuko; points to his seat and tries to act casual.  ] Hey, uh ... I wanted to sit there.",57
Zuko,[  Removing his hood.  ] Just sit next to me. What's the big deal?,57
Aang,"I was just, I wanted to ... okay. [  Sits down.  ]",57
Toph,Why are we sitting in the nosebleed section? My feet can't see a thing from up here!,57
Katara,"Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.",57
Actress Katara,"[  Sighs.  ] Sokka, my only brother! We constantly roam these icy South Pole seas, and yet never do we find anything fulfilling!",57
Actor Sokka,"[  Cut to Actor Sokka, a thin, lanky man.  ] All I want is a full feeling in my stomach! I'm starving!",57
Actress Katara,Is food the only thing on your mind?,57
Actor Sokka,"[  Cut to shot of the actor.  ] Well, I'm trying to get it out of my mind and into my mouth! I'm starving! [  Audience laughs.  ]",57
Sokka,[  Leans forward in his seat; clearly annoyed.  ] This is pathetic! My jokes are way funnier than this! [  Extends his arm in a dramatic gesture.  ],57
Toph,[  Laughing.  ] I think he's got you pegged!,57
Actress Katara,"[  Cut to the stage where Actress Katara now stands in the canoe.  ] Every day, the world awaits a beacon to guide us, yet none appears! [  Cut to close-up of the actress who holds her hand out and clasps her hands together dramatically.  ] Still, we cannot give up hope! For hope, [  Begins to cry.  ] is all we have! And we must never relinquish it, even ... [  Sniffs and falls back into a sitting position.  ] even to our dying breath! [  Leans over the side of the canoe and buries her face in her hands, crying.  ]",57
Katara,"[  With crossed arms, displeased.  ] Well, that's just silly. I don't sound like that.",57
Toph,[  Elated.  ] Oh man! This writer's a genius!,57
Actress Katara,"It appears to be someone frozen in ice, perhaps for a hundred years.",57
Actor Sokka,[  Closer shot of the silhouette swaying from side to side inside the iceberg prop.  ] But who? Who is the boy in the iceberg?,57
Actress Katara,Waterbend! Hi-yah!,57
Actress Katara,"Who are you, frozen boy?",57
Actress Aang,"[  Laughs; in a high-pitched voice.  ] I'm the Avatar, silly, here to spread joy and fun! [  She leans toward Actress Katara, laying a finger on her lips, and also motions toward Actor Sokka before standing upright and spreading her arms out in a cheery gesture.  ]",57
Aang,"Wait, is that a woman playing me?",57
Actress Katara,"[  Gasps.  ] An airbender! [  Clasps her hands to her chest.  ] My heart is so full of hope, [  Drops down on one knee emotionally.  ] that it's making me tearbend! [  Begins to cry and grabs on to Actress Aang's leg. Cut to close-up of Actress Katara who continues to bawl dramatically. Cut back to shot of the entire trio.  ]",57
Actor Sokka,"My stomach is so empty, that it's making  me  tearbend! [  Throws his arms up hopelessly before dropping to his knees, clutching on to Actress Aang's other leg, and crying.  ] I need meat! [  Cut to close-up of Actor Sokka.  ]",57
Actress Aang,"[  Stoops down, puts her arm around Actor Sokka's shoulders, and points upward.  ] But wait! Is that a platter of meaty dumplings? [  Cut to actual Aang whose head and arm rest lazily on the railing, unimpressed.  ]",57
Actor Sokka,"[  Excitedly; shielding his eyes with his hand and turning his head, searching for the alleged dumplings.  ] Ooh, where, where?",57
Actress Aang,[  Laughs and swings arm jovially.  ] Did I mention that I'm an incurable prankster? [  Crosses her legs as the audience laughs.  ],57
Aang,"[  Cut to wide shot of Team Avatar. Aang extends his arm toward the stage, angry with the actress' bad portrayal.  ] I don't do that! That's not what I'm like! And I'm  not  a woman! [  Throws hands up in frustration.  ]",57
Toph,"[  Laughs and turns to face Aang.  ] Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes! [  Continues to laugh.  ]",57
Actor Iroh,"[  Looking toward Actor Zuko, at ease.  ] Prince Zuko, you  must  try this cake! [  Holds up a platter of cake with one slice missing.  ]",57
Actor Zuko,"[  Determined.  ] I don't have time to stuff my face! [  Lowers his telescope and turns to Actor Iroh.  ] I must capture the Avatar to regain my honor! [  Faces out into the audience, clutching his hand in a fist assertively.  ]",57
Actor Iroh,"[  Cut to wide shot of the model ship.  ] Well, while you do that, [  Actor Zuko looks at him, annoyed.  ] maybe I'll capture another slice. [  He holds the cake up higher before bringing it toward his face and proceeding to gobble it down ravenously and noisily.  ]",57
Actor Zuko,"[  Turns his view from Actor Iroh, in disgust.  ] You sicken me!",57
Zuko,[  Gestures toward the stage.  ] They make me look totally stiff and humorless.,57
Katara,"[  Complacently amused.  ] Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on.",57
Zuko,[  In protest; holding his arms out.  ] How could you say that?,57
Actor Iroh,[  Completely at ease.  ] Let's forget about the Avatar and get massages!,57
Actor Zuko,"[  Turns toward his uncle, leaning forward menacingly; shouting.  ] How could you say that?!",57
Actress Aang,"Hey look, I think I found something! [  Tiptoes to the bush. Actor Sokka scratches his head while Actress Katara shrugs. Actress Aang picks up the Momo prop, a rabbit-monkey puppet.  ] It's a flying rabbit-monkey! I think I'll name him, Momo! [  Laughs; using puppet.  ] Hi everybody, I love you! [  The audience laughs.  ]",57
Aang,Ugh.,57
Actor Sokka,[  Pointing to his backside.  ] Does this dress make my butt look fat?,57
Actor Bumi,"Riddles and challenges you must face, [  Camera pans back to show the whole stage.  ] if you are ever to leave this place! [  Laughs.  ]",57
Actress Katara,[  Lifting up a piece of the jennamite prop.  ] Ugh! Oh!,57
Actor Sokka,Why did you have to steal that waterbending scroll?,57
Actress Katara,[  Crying.  ] It just gave me so much hope! [  Katara narrows her eyes.  ],57
Actor Zuko,"The Avatar is mine! [  Looking of stage.  ] Wait, who's coming?",57
Blue Spirit,"[  Jumps on stage holding two swords and has a large mask.  ] I'm the Blue Spirit, the scourge of the Fire Nation, here to save the Avatar!",57
Actress Aang,My hero! [  Jumps on top of the Blue Spirit's large mask.  ],57
Actor Jet,"Don't cry, baby! Jet will wipe out that nasty town for you!",57
Actress Katara,"Oh Jet, you're  so  bad.",57
Actress Aang,[  Gasps.  ] Look! It's the Great Divide! The biggest canyon in the Earth Kingdom!,57
Actor Sokka,"Eh, let's keep flying.",57
Actor Sokka,"Don't go, Yue! You're the only woman who has taken my mind off of food! [  Kisses Yue. Gags.  ] Wait, did you have pickled fish for dinner?",57
Actress Yue,"Goodbye, Sokka! I have important moon duties to take care of! [  Exits on the moon prop.  ] And yes, I did have pickled fish!",57
Suki,[  Laughs.  ] You never told me you made out with a Moon Spirit.,57
Sokka,"[Placing a finger on Suki's lips] Shhh! [  Tearing up.  ] I'm trying to watch! [  Suki, disgusted by Sokka's act, looks away, and folds her arms.  ]",57
Actress Aang,[  Laughs.  ] The Avatar is back to save the day! Yay! [  Actress Aang stomps three more miniature ships before tripping over her Koizilla costume and falling.  ],57
Aang,Ugh!,57
Zuko,"[  Unimpressed  ] So far, this intermission is the best part of the play.",57
Sokka,"[  Walks down the stairs holding a bag of flaming fire flakes and sits next to Suki.  ] Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time!",57
Suki,"[  Hint of sarcasm.  ] Yeah, you tell bad jokes about plenty of other topics.",57
Sokka,[  Eats a fire flake.  ] I know!,57
Aang,[  Angry.  ] At least the Sokka actor kind of looks like you. [  Sokka becomes furious over Aang's remark while Suki gleefully smiles.  ] That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all!,57
Toph,"I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys.",57
Aang,"[  Standing up, angrily.  ] Argh!",57
Katara,"Relax, Aang. They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time. [  Everyone looks at her.  ] What?",57
Aang,"[  Turns around and sits down. Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, that's not you at all.",57
Toph,"Listen friends, it's obvious that the playwright did his research. I know it must hurt, but what you're seeing up there on that stage is the truth.",57
Actress Katara,"Well, here we are in the Earth Kingdom!",57
Actress Aang,[  Opens up her miniature air glider prop.  ] I'd better have a look around to see if I can find an earthbending teacher! [  Jumps up into the air with a cable lifting her up.  ],57
Toph,"This is it, this must be where I come in!",57
Actress Aang,"I flew all over town, but I couldn't find a single earthbending master!",57
Toph,[  Joyfully]  Here it comes ...,57
Actor Toph,"[  Enters the stage from a trapdoor beneath the rock prop and holds it above his head.  ] You can't find an earthbending master in the sky, you have to look underground! [  Throws away the prop.  ]",57
Actress Aang,Who are you?,57
Actor Toph,"[  Spits.  ] My name's Toph, [  Flexes.  ] because it sounds like tough, and that's just what I am! [  Audience laughs.  ]",57
Toph,"Wait a minute, [  Picks at her ear with her pinky.  ] [  confused]  I sound like a guy. A really buff guy.",57
Katara,"Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth. It hurts, doesn't it?",57
Toph,"Are you kidding me? I wouldn't have cast it any other way! [  Laughs as Katara looks away in dismay.  ] At least it's not a flying bald lady! [  Camera pans to Aang, who turns toward the stage in annoyance.  ]",57
Actress Aang,"So, you're blind? [  Waves hand in front of Actor Toph's eyes.  ]",57
Actor Toph,"[  Laughs.  ] I can see you doing that. I see everything that you see, except I don't ""see"" like you do. I release a sonic wave from my mouth. [  Screams very loudly at the Team Avatar players. The audience and Team Avatar grimace at the scream; Aang claps his hands over his ears, Zuko grips the railing in front of him, Suki and Sokka hug each other in terror, and Katara grits her teeth while Toph looks excited.  ] There. I got a pretty good look at you. [  Actress Aang and the audience claps.  ]",57
Actor Iroh,"Zuko, it's time we had a talk ... [  Points to Zuko, who now wears a large wig.  ] about your hair, it's gone too far!",57
Actor Zuko,Maybe it's best if we ... split ... up! [  Actors Zuko and Iroh walk away from each other.  ],57
Actor Zuko,"Azula, my sister, what are you doing here?",57
Actress Azula,"You caught me. Wait, what's that? [  Points in the distance.  ] I think it's your honor!",57
Actor Zuko,Where? [  Everybody looks while Actress Azula escapes through a door.  ],57
Actress Katara,"[  Turning to audience.  ] She escaped, but  how  ?",57
Actress Aang,"If she continues drilling, this wall will come down for sure!",57
Actress Azula,"[  Blocks the rock prop.  ] Haha, yes! Continue drilling! The city of Ba Sing Se can hide no longer!",57
Actress Aang,"No, Jet! What did they do to you?",57
Actor Jet,Must ... serve ... Earth King! [  Begins swinging his hook hand wildly at Actress Aang and Actor Sokka.  ] Must ... destroy!,57
Zuko,Did Jet just ... die?,57
Sokka,"You know, it was really unclear.",57
Actress Katara,"I have to admit Prince Zuko, I  really  find you attractive!",57
Actor Zuko,[  Shot changes to show him sitting on a rock bench.  ] You don't have to make fun of me.,57
Actress Katara,"But I mean it! [  Sits down with Actor Zuko.  ] I've had eyes for you since the day you first captured me! [  Zuko and Katara inch away from each other, slightly uncomfortable. Aang narrows his eyebrows.  ]",57
Actor Zuko,"[  Stands up.  ] Wait, I thought you were the Avatar's girl! [  Aang nods.  ]",57
Actress Katara,"[  Laughs.  ] The Avatar? [  Stands up and walks toward Actor Zuko.  ] Why, he's like a little brother to me! [  Laughs.  ] I certainly don't think of him in a romantic way. [  Aang grows concerned.  ] Besides, how could he ever find out about ... this? [  Actress Katara and Actor Zuko embrace and hold hands while Actress Katara pops up one leg. Aang gets up.  ]",57
Sokka,"[  Whispering.  ] Oh, you're getting up? [  As Aang leaves.  ] Can you get me some fire flakes? [  Puts his arm around Suki, but whispers to Aang again.  ] Ooh, and fire gummies! [  Puts his arm back around Suki, who looks slightly annoyed.  ]",57
Actress Azula,"Well, my brother, what's it going to be? Your nation, or a life of treachery?",57
Actor Iroh,"[  Stops drinking from a cup.  ] Choose treachery, it's more fun! [  Winks and gives a thumbs up sign.  ]",57
Actress Azula,No way!,57
Actor Zuko,"[  Pushes Actor Iroh over and walks to Actress Azula.  ] I hate you, Uncle! You smell, and I hate you for all time!",57
Katara,"[  To Zuko.  ] You didn't really say that, did you?",57
Zuko,I might as well have.,57
Actress Aang,"Avatar State, yip yip!",57
Actress Azula,Not if my lightning can help it!,57
Actress Azula,The Avatar is no more!,57
Suki,"It seems like every time there's a big battle, you guys barely make it out alive. I mean, you guys lose a lot!",57
Sokka,"You're one to talk, Suki. Didn't Azula take you captive? That's right, she did!",57
Suki,[  Looks at Sokka seriously.  ] Are you trying to get on my bad side?,57
Sokka,I'm just saying ...,57
Katara,Does anyone know where Aang is?,57
Sokka,"He left to get me fire gummies, like, ten minutes ago. And I'm still waiting!",57
Katara,I'm gonna check outside.,57
Katara,Are you all right?,57
Aang,"[  Angered.  ] No, I'm not! I hate this play! [  Yanks his hat off and throws it on the ground.  ]",57
Katara,"I know it's upsetting, but it sounds like you're overreacting.",57
Aang,"Overreacting? If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State right now!",57
Sokka,"Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage? I got some jokes I want to give to the actor me.",57
Suki,[  Seriously.  ] I'm an elite warrior who's trained for many years in the art of stealth. [  Smiling.  ] I think I could get you backstage! [  Sokka and Suki leave.  ],57
Toph,"[  To Zuko, after observing everyone's reactions.  ] Geez, everyone's getting so upset about their characters. Even you seem more down than usual, and that's saying something!",57
Zuko,"You don't get it, it's different for you. You get a muscly version of yourself, taking down ten bad guys at once, and making sassy remarks.",57
Toph,"Yeah, that's pretty great!",57
Zuko,"But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life, and shoves them back in my face. My uncle, he's always been on my side, even when things were bad. He was there for me, he taught me so much, and how do I repay him? With a knife in his back. It's my greatest regret, and I may never get to redeem myself.",57
Toph,"[  Sits down next to him.  ] You have redeemed yourself to your uncle. You don't realize it, but you already have.",57
Zuko,How do you know?,57
Toph,"Because I once had a long conversation with the guy, and all he would talk about was you.",57
Zuko,Really?,57
Toph,"Yeah, and it was kind of annoying.",57
Zuko,"Oh, sorry.",57
Toph,"But it was also very sweet. All your uncle wanted was for you to find your own path, and see the light. Now you're here with us. He'd be proud. [  Punches Zuko on the shoulder.  ]",57
Zuko,Ow! What was that for?,57
Toph,That's how I show affection.,57
Young boy,"Your Zuko costume's pretty good, but your scar's on the wrong side. [  Runs off.  ]",57
Zuko,The scar's not on the wrong side! [  Covers his face with his hood.  ],57
Suki,He's coming this way!,57
Actor Sokka,Can I help you?,57
Sokka,"Actually, I think I can help you. I'm a big Sokka fan, but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be.",57
Actor Sokka,"[  Starts walking away.  ] Aww no, another fan with ideas.",57
Sokka,[  Runs in front of him.  ] Just hear me out. [  Pulls out some cards.  ] Here's something I think the real Sokka would say. [  Clears throat.  ] What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages? A cabbage patch!,57
Actor Sokka,"[  Chuckles.  ] That's actually pretty good! Let me see those! [  Takes the cards from Sokka. Reads one and laughs.  ] ""A rocky relationship"" ... not bad!",57
Sokka,"[  Puts his arm around Actor Sokka's shoulder.  ] Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases, especially before an attack. Something like ... ""Flying kick-a-pow!"". [  The two begin to walk away.  ]",57
Actor Sokka,"Who are you, anyway?",57
Sokka,I'm just a guy who likes comedy.,57
Aang,"Katara, did you really mean what you said in there?",57
Katara,In where? What are you talking about?,57
Aang,"On stage, when you said I was just like a ... brother to you, and you didn't have feelings for me.",57
Katara,I didn't say that. An actor said that.,57
Aang,"But it's true, isn't it? We kissed at the Invasion, and I thought we were gonna be together. But we're not.",57
Katara,"Aang, I don't know.",57
Aang,Why don't you know?,57
Katara,"Because, we're in the middle of a war, and, we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time.",57
Aang,"Well, when is the right time?",57
Katara,"Aang, I'm sorry, but right now I'm just a little confused.",57
Katara,I just said I was confused! I'm going inside. [  Exits the balcony.  ],57
Aang,"[  Frustrated.  ] Ugh, I'm such an idiot! [  Puts down his head on the balcony railing.  ]",57
Sokka,"Here's what you missed ... we went to the Fire Nation, and you got better, and Katara was the Painted Lady, and I got a sword, and I think Combustion Man died. Oh, look, the Invasion's about to start! Shhh!",57
Actress Katara,"I just wanted to let you know, Aang, that I'll always love you. Like a brother.",57
Actress Aang,[  Punching the air.  ] I wouldn't want it any other way!,57
Actor Sokka,"Hey Toph, would you say you and Aang have a ""rocky relationship""? [  Audience laughs.  ]",57
Sokka,[  Laughs hysterically at Suki and Aang. Lifts up Aang's hat.  ] I told him to say that!,57
Actor Sokka,I hope everyone's ready for the Invasion! Slap-a-pow! [  The audience and Sokka laugh.  ],57
Actress Aang,"We finally made it to the Royal Palace, but no one's home!",57
Actor Zuko,"Actually, I'm home, and I want to join you!",57
Actor Sokka,"[  Lowers his boomerang.  ] I guess we have no choice. Come on! [  All exit stage left, except for Actress Aang, who is lifted off stage.  ]",57
Sokka,[  Stands up and stretches.  ] I guess that's it. The play's caught up to the present now.,57
Suki,"Wait, the play's not over!",57
Sokka,"[  Sits back down.  ] But it is over, unless ... [  Dramatically.  ] this is the future.",57
Actor Ozai,"With the energy harnessed from that comet, no one will be able to stop ... [  Lifts his hands in the air.  ] the Fire Nation!",57
Actress Azula,"Father, Zuko and the Avatar are at the Palace. They're trying to stop you!",57
Actor Ozai,You take care of Zuko. I shall face the Avatar myself! [  Disappears behind a smokescreen.  ],57
Actor Zuko,"Aang! You find the Fire Lord, I'll hold her off!",57
Actress Azula,You are no longer my brother. You are an enemy!,57
Actor Zuko,No! I am the rightful heir to the throne!,57
Actress Azula,We'll see!,57
Actor Zuko,Honor! [  He drops off stage through a trapdoor with the flames.  ],57
Actor Ozai,"So, you have mastered all four elements?",57
Actress Aang,"[  Pointing her staff prop at him.  ] Yeah, and now you're going down!",57
Actor Ozai,"No! It is  you  who are going down! [  Stands up.  ] You see, you are too late! The comet is already here, [  Actress Aang looks in concern at the audience. Aang widens his eyes.  ] and I'm unstoppable!",57
Actress Aang,[  Becomes wrapped in the fire blanket.  ] Noooo ...! [  Falls to the stage with her eyes closed.  ],57
Actress Azula,"It is over, Father. We've done it!",57
Actor Ozai,"Yes! We have done it! The dreams of my father, [  Large fire sheets rise behind him and a platform lifts him up.  ] and my father's father, have now been realized! [  A Fire Nation flag drops.  ] The world ... is ... mine!",57
Zuko,That ... wasn't a good play.,57
Aang,I'll say.,57
Katara,No kidding.,57
Suki,Horrible.,57
Toph,You said it.,57
Sokka,[  Walking with Suki.  ] But the effects were decent.,57
Zuko,More ferocious! Imagine striking through your opponent's heart!,58
Aang,[  Stops firebending and turns to Zuko while growling in irritatation.  ] I'm trying.,58
Zuko,Now let me hear you roar like a tigerdillo! [  Aang gives a light roar as fire bursts come out of his hands and mouth; cuts to a front scene of his embarrassed grin.  ] That sounded pathetic! I said  roar  !,58
Katara,[  Holding up two watermelons.  ] Who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice?,58
Aang,"[  Brightens up upon hearing this.  ] Ooh, ooh! Me, me, me! [  Runs to Katara.  ]",58
Zuko,"[  Zuko's hand comes into screen and grabs Aang by the shirt of his robes.  ] Hey! [  Aang keeps trying to run off, but it is useless.  ] Your lesson's not over yet! Get back here! [  Holds Aang up.  ]",58
Suki,"[  Lounging on stairs with Sokka.  ] Come on, Zuko. Just take a break. What's the big deal?",58
Zuko,"[  Lets Aang go.  ] Fine! [  Aang happily runs off and takes a watermelon.  ] If you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day, then go ahead! [  Walks away.  ]",58
Sokka,"Maybe Zuko's right. Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know [  Lays his watermelon aside and stands up slowly.  ] just the thing to change all that. [  Takes off his robe, revealing a bathing suit.  ] Beach party!",58
Aang,Check out my Appa sand sculpture. [  Appa roars at the sculpture.  ],58
Toph,"Not bad, baldy, [  Aang jumps off the sculpture.  ] but I've been working on my sandbending. [  Cracks her fingers.  ] You're gonna love this.",58
Aang,"[  Amazed.  ] Whoa! Wow, you've even made a little Earth King and Bosco.",58
Toph,"Try and top  that  , Sokka.",58
Sokka,"[  Reveals a grotesque looking sculpture with seaweed for hair, a starfish for a nose, and rocks and shells for eyes and mouth.  ] Ta da!",58
Aang,Is that a blubbering blob monster?,58
Sokka,"[  Defensively.  ] No, it's Suki!",58
Toph,"Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this.",58
Suki,[  Sitting on a beach towel.  ] I think it's sweet.,58
Aang,But it doesn't even look like- Aah!,58
Aang,[  Peeking out from behind the sculpture fearfully.  ] What are you doing?,58
Zuko,Teaching you a lesson!,58
Katara,What happened?,58
Sokka,"[  While rebuilding his sculpture.  ] Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki and he destroyed it! [  Pauses a moment.  ] Oh, and he's attacking Aang.",58
Aang,Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!,58
Zuko,Go ahead and do it!,58
Aang,Enough!,58
Katara,[  Worried.  ] What's wrong with you? You could have hurt Aang!,58
Zuko,What's wrong with  me  ? What's wrong with all of you? How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet is only three days away? [  Everybody looks at Zuko.  ] Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy?,58
Aang,About Sozin's Comet ... I was actually gonna wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.,58
Zuko,[  Shocked.  ] After?,58
Aang,I'm not ready. I need more time to master firebending.,58
Toph,"And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too. [  Aang grimaces.  ]",58
Zuko,"So, you all knew Aang was going to wait?",58
Sokka,"Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord now, he's going to lose. [  Aang looks over to Sokka as he says this, frowns, and closes his eyes in defeat. To Aang.  ] No offense.",58
Katara,"The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the Comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the War, but they pretty much won the War when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse.",58
Zuko,"You're wrong. [  Turns away from them.  ] It's about to get worse than you can even imagine. [  Flashes back to one day before the Day of Black Sun. Servants help Zuko get dressed on his way to a meeting. Once done, they stay behind and bow to him as he walks on. Voice-over.  ] The day before the eclipse, my father asked me to attend an important war meeting. It was what I dreamed about for so many years. My father had finally accepted me back.",58
Ozai,"Welcome, Prince Zuko. We waited for you. [  Zuko walks up to his father. He bows to Ozai and sits down next to him.  ] General Shinu, your report.",58
Shinu,"Thank you, sir. [  Stands up and walks up to the opposite side of Ozai across the table.  ] Ba Sing Se is still under our control. However, earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving total victory in the Earth Kingdom.",58
Ozai,What is your recommendation?,58
Shinu,"Our army is spread too thin, but once the eclipse is over and the invasion defeated, we should transfer more domestic forces into the Earth Kingdom.",58
Ozai,"Hmm. Prince Zuko, you've been among the Earth Kingdom commoners. Do you think that adding more troops will stop these rebellions?",58
Zuko,"The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything, as long as they have hope.",58
Ozai,"Yes, you're right. We need to destroy their hope.",58
Zuko,"Well, that's not exactly what I-",58
Azula,I  think you should take their precious hope and the rest of their land and burn it all to the ground.,58
Ozai,"Yes ... [  Cuts to Azula looking pleased.  ] Yes you're right, Azula. [  Stands up and walks to the world map.  ] Sozin's Comet is almost upon us, and on that day, it will endow us with the strength and power of a hundred suns. No bender will stand a chance against us.",58
Shinu,"What are you suggesting, sir?",58
Ozai,"When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. [  Cut to Zuko.  ] Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom ... [  Zuko looks astonished. Cut back to Ozai smiling.  ] permanently. [  The shot changes to an aerial view of the map which Ozai walks to the center.  ] From our airships, we will rain fire over their lands, a fire that will destroy  everything  ; and out of the ashes, a new world will be born, a world in which  all  the lands are Fire Nation and  I  am the supreme ruler of everything! [  War generals applaud.  ]",58
Zuko,"[  Voice-over.  ] I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan, but I'm ashamed to say I didn't. [  Fade to the present.  ] My whole life, I struggled to gain my father's love and acceptance, but once I had it, I realized I'd lost myself getting there. I'd forgotten who I was.",58
Katara,[  Sinks to her knees.  ] I can't believe this.,58
Sokka,"I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy, but his plan is just pure evil.",58
Aang,What am I gonna do?,58
Zuko,"[  Stands up from his rock seat and walks to Aang.  ] I know you're scared, and I know you're not ready to save the world, but if you don't defeat the Fire Lord before the comet comes, there won't be a world to save anymore.",58
Aang,Why didn't you tell me about your dad's crazy plan sooner? [  Walks away.  ],58
Zuko,I didn't think I had to. I assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told  me  you decided to wait.,58
Aang,"[  Holding his head with both hands.  ] This is bad. [  Sinks down to his knees.  ] This is really, really bad.",58
Katara,"Aang, you don't have to do this alone.",58
Toph,"Yeah, if we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down.",58
Sokka,All right! Team Avatar is back! Air. [  Shot of Aang.  ] Water. [  Shot of Katara.  ] Earth. [  Shot of Toph.  ] Fire. [  Shot of Zuko. Sokka gives Suki a clump of leaves and holds up a large leaf.  ] Fan and sword! [  Sokka's leaf wilts.  ],58
Aang,"Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together, but I wouldn't want to do it any other way.",58
Toph,Yeah.,58
Sokka,All right.,58
Katara,"Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.",58
Zuko,"There's one technique you need to know before facing my father - how to redirect lightning. [  Aang smiles.  ] If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. [  Uses his fingers to show how the energy should flow through the body.  ] You turn your opponents' energy against them.",58
Aang,That's like waterbending. [  Joins Zuko in practicing the lightning redirection form.  ],58
Zuko,Exactly. My uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders.,58
Aang,"So, have  you  ever redirected lightning before?",58
Zuko,"Once, against my father.",58
Aang,What did it feel like?,58
Zuko,"[  Stops practicing the lightning redirection form.  ] Exhilarating ... [  Flashes back to the moment for a few seconds.  ] but terrifying. You feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body, but you know if you make the wrong move, it's over.",58
Aang,"[  Chuckles.  ] Well, not  over  over. I mean there's always Katara and a little Spirit Water action, [  Turns to Katara.  ] am I right?",58
Katara,"Actually, I used it all up after Azula shot you.",58
Aang,[  Disappointed.  ] Oh.,58
Zuko,You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life before he takes yours.,58
Aang,"Yeah, I'll just do that.",58
Sokka,"Gather round, Team Avatar. [  Puts a carved melon on a draped mannequin.  ] In order to take out the Fire Lord - or in this case, the Melon Lord - our timing has to be perfect. [  Kneels down on the ground and uses a stick to draw a line heading toward the Melon Lord symbol.  ] First, Suki and I will draw his fire. Then, Katara and Zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense, [  Draws another line.  ] and while the Melon Lord is distracted, [  Draws a third line.  ] Aang swoops in ... and bam! [  Destroys the Melon Lord symbol with the line.  ] He delivers the final blow.",58
Toph,Uh ... what about me?,58
Sokka,"For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces.",58
Toph,[  Excited.  ] So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?,58
Sokka,Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.,58
Toph,Sweetness.,58
Toph,Mwah-ha-ha-ha!,58
Sokka,"Watch it, Toph!",58
Toph,I am not Toph. I am Melon Lord! Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!,58
Sokka,"Now, Aang!",58
Zuko,What are you waiting for? Take him out!,58
Aang,[  Shaking his head.  ] I can't.,58
Sokka,"[  Walks up to Aang.  ] What's wrong with you? If this was the real deal, you'd be shot full of lightning right now.",58
Aang,"I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself.",58
Sokka,"[  Off-camera.  ] There, that's how it's done.",58
Katara,[  Holding a scroll.  ] I have a surprise for everyone!,58
Toph,"I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru! [  She smiles while Sokka, Suki, and Zuko look at her strangely.  ]",58
Katara,"Uh, no. [  Everybody else starts eating again.  ] I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this! [  Unravels the scroll showing a painting of a happy dark-haired baby playing at the beach.  ] Look at baby Zuko. Isn't he cute?",58
Katara,"[  To Zuko.  ] Oh, lighten up. I'm just teasing.",58
Zuko,That's not me. It's my father.,58
Suki,But he looks so sweet and innocent.,58
Zuko,"Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers.",58
Aang,[  The camera pans to him.  ] But he's still a human being.,58
Zuko,You're going to defend him?,58
Aang,"No, I agree with you. [  Stands up.  ] Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way.",58
Zuko,Like what?,58
Aang,"I don't know. [  Perking up.  ] Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore.",58
Zuko,"[  Sarcastically.  ] Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again. [  Suki and Sokka laugh in the background.  ]",58
Aang,[  Excitedly.  ] Do you really think that would work?,58
Zuko,[  Bluntly.  ] No!,58
Aang,[  Sighs. Paces back and forth.  ] This goes against everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like.,58
Sokka,"Sure you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you.",58
Aang,"[  Turns back to Sokka; losing his temper.  ] This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understand the position I'm in.",58
Katara,"Aang, we do understand. It's just ...",58
Aang,"Just what, Katara? What?",58
Katara,We're trying to help!,58
Aang,"Then, when you figure out a way for me to beat the Fire Lord without taking his life, I'd love to hear it! [  Walks away.  ]",58
Katara,"Aang, don't walk away from this. [  Walks toward Aang.  ]",58
Zuko,[  Puts a hand on Katara's shoulder to stop her.  ] Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself.,58
Aang,"[  Stroking the lemur's head.  ] Hey, Momo. I don't suppose  you  know what I should do. [  Momo squawks.  ] I didn't think so.",58
Sokka,"Okay, that's everything.",58
Toph,"No, it's not. Where's Aang?",58
Zuko,Aang? Aang!,58
Toph,"Come on, lazy bones, let's go.",58
Sokka,He left his staff. [  Picks up the staff.  ] That's so strange.,58
Zuko,[  Walks onto the porch with Toph.  ] Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach. [  Turns his head toward the beach.  ],58
Sokka,"Look, there's his footprints. [  The camera pans up toward Aang's footprints, which stop at the beach.  ] The trail ends here.",58
Suki,"So, he went for a midnight swim and never came back?",58
Katara,Maybe he was captured.,58
Sokka,I don't think so. [  Examining the footprints.  ] There's no sign of a struggle.,58
Toph,I bet he ran away again.,58
Sokka,Uh-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.,58
Toph,"Then what do  you  think happened to him, oh sleuthy one?",58
Sokka,It's pretty obvious. Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.,58
Zuko,"But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?",58
Sokka,"[  Downcast.  ] Oh, yeah. Forgot about that.",58
Katara,Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him.,58
Toph,"I'm going with Zuko! [  Sokka, Suki, and Katara stare at her.  ] What?! Everyone else went on a life-changing field trip with Zuko. Now it's my turn.",58
Crowd,"[  Chanting.  ] Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! [  Shocked, Katara and Suki glance at each other and simultaneously run into the circle.  ]",58
Actress Aang,[  In the center of the crowd.  ] Avatar State! [  Actor Toph lifts her up in the air.  ] Yip-yip! [  Crowd cheers.  ],58
Toph,"And then when I was nine, I ran away again.",58
Zuko,Uh-huh.,58
Toph,"I know I shouldn't complain. My parents gave me everything I ever asked for, but they never gave me the one thing I really wanted, their love. You know what I mean?",58
Zuko,"[  Sighs and stops walking.  ] Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang. [  Continues walking.  ]",58
Toph,This is the worst field trip ever. [  Sighs and continues walking.  ],58
Sokka,"Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either. [  Jumps off Appa.  ]",58
Zuko,No. It's like he just ... disappeared.,58
Toph,"Hey, wait a minute. Has anyone noticed that Momo is missing, too?",58
Sokka,"[  Turns back to Appa.  ] Oh no! I knew it was only a matter of time! [  Jumps down to Appa.  ] Appa ate Momo! [  Lifts up Appa's mouth.  ] Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy.",58
Katara,"Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang.",58
Sokka,That's just what Appa wants you to think. [  Climbs into Appa's mouth.  ],58
Zuko,"Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka. We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away.",58
Katara,What should we do Zuko?,58
Zuko,[  Stands up.  ] I don't know. [  They keep staring.  ] Why are you all looking at  me  ?,58
Katara,"Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang.",58
Toph,"Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar ... it's you.",58
Sokka,"Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there.",58
Zuko,Just trust me.,58
Azula,[  To her palanquin bearers.  ] Come on slowpokes! Faster!,58
Azula,"[  Pants.  ] Sorry I'm late, father. Good palanquin bearers are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure?",58
Ozai,"[  Facing the ship.  ] There has been a change of plans, Azula.",58
Azula,[  Worried.  ] What?,58
Ozai,I've decided to lead the fleet of airships to Ba Sing Se alone. You will remain here in the Fire Nation.,58
Azula,But I thought we were going to do this together.,58
Ozai,My decision is final.,58
Azula,You ... you can't treat me like this! [  Rising.  ] You can't treat me like Zuko!,58
Ozai,"Azula, silence yourself.",58
Azula,But it was  my  idea to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side!,58
Ozai,Azula! [  She bows her head.  ] Listen to me. I need you here to watch over the homeland. It's a very important job that I can only entrust to you.,58
Azula,Really?,58
Ozai,"And for your loyalty, I've decided to declare you the new Fire Lord.",58
Azula,"Fire Lord Azula? It does seem appropriate, but what about you?",58
Ozai,"Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the world will be reborn in fire, I shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the world. [  Three Fire Sages help Ozai put on his new royal garments.  ] From this moment on, I will be known as ... [  Raises his arms in the air.  ] the Phoenix King.",58
Katara,And the reason you've brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?,58
Zuko,[  Pointing.  ] June.,58
Sokka,"[  Off-camera.  ] Oh yeah, that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole.",58
Suki,[  Off-camera.  ] Mole? Her skin is flawless.,58
Sokka,"No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on.",58
Zuko,The shirshu. It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the world. It's the one shot we have of finding him.,58
Toph,"[  Stepping forward, grinning broadly.  ] I don't know who this June lady is, but I like her.",58
Aang,"[  Waking up.  ] Hey, Momo. I just had the strangest dream. [  Looks around surprised at his new setting.  ] Wait. [  The camera pans toward the ocean and shows an aerial shot of the island.  ] Where are we?",58
Sokka,"[  To Zuko.  ] Hey, I remember her! [  Cut to frontal view of Zuko, Sokka standing behind.  ] She helped you attack us!",59
Zuko,Yup. [  Walks forward.  ] Back in the good old days.,59
June,Oh great. It's Prince Pouty. [  Close-up.  ] Where's your creepy grandpa?,59
Zuko,[  Frontal view of Katara and Zuko.  ] He's my uncle. And he's not here.,59
June,[  Close-up.  ] I see you worked things out with your girlfriend.,59
Katara,[  Angrily.  ] I'm not his girlfriend!,59
Zuko,[  Speaking at the same time.  ] She's not my girlfriend!,59
June,"[  Frontal view.  ] Okay, okay. Sheesh. I was only teasing. So what do you want?",59
Zuko,[  Frontal view of June with Zuko and Suki behind.  ] I need your help finding the Avatar.,59
June,Hm. Doesn't sound too fun. [  Sips her tea.  ],59
Zuko,"[  Angrily; leans closer, while clenching his fists.  ] Does the end of the world sound like more fun?",59
June,"[  Shaking the piece of meat.  ] Nyla. [  She throws the meat to Nyla. Cut to frontal view of Nyla, who catches it in his mouth and starts chewing it before swallowing it; June walks up to him and starts petting him.  ] Who's my little, hmm, Snuffly-Wuffly? [  Nyla sticks his toxins-coated tongue out and she dodges it and forces his mouth closed.  ] Whoa! Careful there. [  To Team Avatar.  ] Okay. So who's got something with the Avatar's scent on it?",59
Katara,[  Pulls out Aang's glider from Appa's saddle.  ] I have Aang's staff.,59
Zuko,"[  Frontal view.  ] Well, what does that mean?",59
June,[  Frontal view. Petting Nyla.  ] Means your friend's gone.,59
Toph,[  Frontal view.  ] We know he's gone. That's why we're trying to find him.,59
June,"[  Close-up as June stands up.  ] No, I mean he's  gone  gone. [  Turns to face everyone else.  ] He doesn't exist.",59
Aang,"Where are we, Momo? [  Cut to view of the sky through the trees as dragonflies fly past. The camera pans down as Aang speaks.  ] Maybe I'm in the Spirit World? [  Cut to frontal view of Aang stepping under a branch.  ] But wait. You can see me. [  Momo approaches on the branch. Cut to a close-up of Momo.  ] We could both be in the Spirit World. [  Cut back to Aang. He uses airbending and the camera pans across as he moves.  ] Nope. My bending works. [  Momo lands on him. Points to the hilltop. Cut to path up a hill. Camera pans up as Aang talks.  ] Maybe if we climb to the top of the island, we can figure out where we are.",59
Sokka,"[  To June.  ] What do you mean Aang doesn't exist? [  Side-view of the group.  ] Do you mean he's ... you know, dead?",59
June,"[  Frontal view as she pets Nyla.  ] Nope. We could find him if he were dead. Wow, it's a real head-scratcher. See ya. [  Cut to a wide-view of the group as she starts climbing on top of Nyla.  ]",59
Toph,[  Sarcastically.  ] Helpful. Real helpful.,59
Zuko,[  To June.  ] Wait. I have another idea. [  Frontal view.  ] There's only one other person in this world who can help us face the Fire Lord. I'll be right back with a smell sample.,59
Sokka,You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal? Ugh! [  Pinches nose even tighter.  ],59
Toph,[  Smiles.  ] I think it's kind of sweet.,59
June,[  Frontal view. Determined.  ] Let's do this. [  Cut to wide-view as she and Nyla run off.  ],59
Zuko,Hey! Wait up!,59
Zuko,We're going to Ba Sing Se?,59
June,[  Cut to side-view of the group as Nyla continues scratching the wall.  ] Your uncle's somewhere beyond the wall. [  Nyla stops digging and walks away.  ] Nyla's getting twitchy so he can't be too far. [  Close-up.  ] Good luck.,59
Zuko,It's been a long day. [  Aerial view. Camera zooms out.  ] Let's camp and start our search again at dawn.,59

Avatar Roku,"[  Side-view.  ] I ... don't know, Aang. [  Close-up of Aang.  ] But I see you are lost in more ways than one right now.",59

Avatar Roku,"[  Frontal view.  ] In my life, I tried to be disciplined and show restraint, but it backfired when Fire Lord Sozin took advantage of my restraint and mercy.

Pakku,"[  Bows back.  ] It is respectful to bow to an old master, [  Frontal view. Extends his arms out.  ] but how about a hug for your new grandfather?",59
Katara,"[  Frontal view. Surprised and overjoyed, as is Sokka behind her.  ] That's so exciting! [  Frontal view of Pakku as she hugs Pakku.  ] You and Gran-Gran must be so happy to have found each other again!",59

Kyoshi,"[  Close-up side-view.  ] Personally, I don't really see the difference, but I assure you, I would have done whatever it took to stop Chin. [  Frontal view.  ] I offer you this wisdom, Aang: Only justice will bring peace. [  Vanishes.  ]",59

Yangchen,"[  Side-view of Aang and Yangchen.

Iroh,"Even if I did defeat Ozai, [  Close-up.  ] and I don't know that I could, it would be the wrong way to end the war.

Zuko,[  Close-up of Zuko from over Iroh's shoulder.  ] And then ... then you would come and take your rightful place on the throne?,59
Iroh,"[  Close-up.  ] No. Someone new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart [  Frontal view from the side of Iroh as the camera zooms in on Zuko.  ] and unquestionable honor. It has to be  you  , Prince Zuko.",59
Zuko,[  Zuko briefly looks away.  ] Unquestionable honor? But I've made so many mistakes.,59
Iroh,"Yes, you have. [  Close-up of Iroh from over Zuko's shoulder.  ] You've struggled; you've suffered, but you have always followed your own path. [  Close-up of Zuko.  ] You restored your  own  honor, and only you can restore the honor of the Fire Nation.",59

Zuko,I can handle Azula.,59
Iroh,Not alone! [  Frontal view of Iroh from the side of Zuko.  ] You'll need help.,59

Iroh,[  Close-up.  ] What do you think it is?,59

Azula,"Yes, it is. So, please. Tell me why, on the most important day of my life, you've decided to leave a pit in my cherry? [  Throws the pit at the servant, who winces slightly from the impact.  ]",60
Banished servant,It wasn't a decision; it was just a small mistake.,60

Azula,"Five, to be precise, in which time an assassin could've snuck in, done away with me and been on his merry way!",60
Head of Dai Li,"My apologies, Princess.",60
Azula,Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord? With tardiness and disloyalty?,60

Li,Perhaps it's best if you postponed your coronation.,60
Azula,"[  In anger, glaring at Lo and Li.  ] What? Which one of you just said that?",60
Azula,What a shame ... there's only one way to resolve this. You two must duel each other. I order you to fight an Agni Kai!,60

Ursa,"[  Cuts to shot of Azula looking at her reflection in the mirror, clearly angered; off-camera.  ] I think you're confused. All your life you used fear to control people, like your friends Mai and Ty Lee.",60

Toph and Sokka,Jump!,60
Fire Sage,"By decree of Phoenix King Ozai, I now crown you Fire Lord ...",60
Azula,[  Somewhat annoyed.  ] What are you waiting for? Do it!,60
Zuko,"Sorry, but you're not gonna become Fire Lord today. [  Jumps off Appa.  ]  I  am.",60
Azula,[  Laughs.  ] You're hilarious.,60
Katara,[  Jumps off of Appa to stand beside Zuko.  ] And you're going down.,60
Azula,"Wait. You want to be Fire Lord? Fine. Let's settle this. Just you and me, brother. The showdown that was always meant to be. Agni Kai!",60
Zuko,[  Seriously.  ] You're on.,60
Katara,"What are you doing? She's playing you. She knows she can't take us both, so she's trying to separate us.",60
Zuko,I know. But I can take her this time.,60
Katara,But even  you  admitted to your uncle that you would need help facing Azula.,60
Zuko,"There's something off about her; I can't explain it but she's slipping. And this way, no one else has to get hurt.",60
Azula,"[  Slightly sarcastic.  ] I'm sorry it has to end this way,  brother  .",60
Zuko,[  Getting in his stance.  ] No you're not.,60
Zuko,[  Angrily and somewhat mockingly.  ] No lightning today? What's the matter? [  Quickly assuming his lightning redirection stance.  ] Afraid I'll redirect it?,60
Azula,"Oh, I'll  show  you lightning!",60
Zuko,[  In slow motion as he comes in front of Katara.  ] No!,60
Katara,[  Yelling.  ] Zuko!,60
Ozai,"You're weak, just like the rest of your people! They did not deserve to exist in this world ... in my world! Prepare to join them. Prepare to die!",60
Ozai,"[  Yelling out to Aang tauntingly while using a flamethrower blast with his hair swaying in the wind.  ] Come on out, Avatar! You can't hide in there forever!",61
Sokka,"Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others.",61
Toph,"Got it! [  She moves Sokka out of the way, spits into her hands, and rubs them together. Toph grips and metalbends the rudder while grunting in effort, and the Imperial Firebenders inside the ship crash into the wall, and due to the action, the ship crashes into the others.  ]",61
Sokka,Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?,61
Toph,[  Pleased.  ] You could stand to mention it more.,61
Sokka,[  In pain.  ] My leg! Hang on Toph!,61
Toph,"Aye, aye, Captain.",61
Sokka,"[  Sadly.  ] Bye, space sword.",61
Sokka,"I don't think boomerang's coming back, Toph. It looks like this is the end. [  Toph starts crying and the firebenders run away. The airship gets struck by a different one and Sokka lets Toph fall onto it before jumping down himself, hurting his leg again in the process. He falls over in pain.  ]",61
Toph,How did that happen? Did boomerang come back?,61
Sokka,"[  Looking up.  ] No, Suki did. [  They see Suki riding on the last functioning airship with a triumphant smile.  ]",61
Ozai,"Come on out, little boy. You're about to be ...",61
Azula,"I'd really rather our family physician look after Little Zuzu if you don't mind. [  Azula shoots lightning and fire at her from the roof of a building. Katara manages to dodge them all and hides behind a column nearby. To Zuko in a taunting manner.  ] Zuzu, you don't look so good!",61
Azula,"There you are, filthy peasant!",61
Zuko,"Thank you, Katara.",61
Katara,I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.,61
Aang,"[  With the voices of all previous Avatars.  ] Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now you shall pay the ultimate price! [  Aang, under control of his past lives, combines all four elements together for his final attack. At the last second, however, he manages to regain control; he comes out of the Avatar State, lets his attack die out, and floats to the ground, freeing Ozai in the process. He now speaks in his normal voice.  ] No, I'm not gonna end it like this.",61
Ozai,"Even with all the power in the world, you are still weak!",61
Lion turtle,"In the era before the Avatar, we bent not the elements but the energy within ourselves.",61
Lion turtle,"[  Aang remembering.  ] To bend another's energy, your own spirit must be unbendable or you will be corrupted and destroyed.",61
Ozai,[  Out of breath.  ] What? What did you do to me?,61
Aang,I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.,61
Sokka,"You did it! You should've seen yourself, it was amazing! You were all like [  Pretends to be Aang fighting Ozai while adding sound effects.  ] and the Fire Lord was all like [  Pretends to be Ozai struggling and groaning.  ]",61
Suki,"[  Pointing to the exhausted Ozai while approaching him.  ] So did you, you know ... finish the job?",61
Ozai,[  Defiantly and slowly.  ] I'm still alive. [  Suki backs away from him.  ],61
Aang,I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away.,61
Toph,[  Surprised.  ] Wow! Who taught you that?,61
Aang,A giant lion turtle.,61
Toph,[  Smiling.  ] You have the craziest adventures when you disappear.,61
Sokka,"Well, look at you, buster. Now that your firebending's gone I guess we should call you the Loser Lord.",61
Ozai,[  Weakly.  ] I am the Phoenix King! [  Flops on the ground while semi-conscious and drooling.  ],61
Toph,"[  Mockingly.  ] Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Phoenix King of Getting His Butt Whooped.",61
Suki,[  Patheically.  ] Yeah! Or how about King of the ... Guys Who ... Don't Win?,61
Toph,"[  Pointing at Suki before pointing to herself; gently.  ] Leave the nicknames to us, honey.",61
Mai,You need some help with that?,61
Zuko,Mai! You're okay! They let you out of prison?,61
Mai,My uncle pulled some strings. And it doesn't hurt when the new Fire Lord is your boyfriend.,61
Zuko,So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?,61
Mai,"[  Blushes.  ] I think it means I actually kind of like you. [  They kiss. When they break apart, Mai's tone and expression changes to a serious and stern one.  ] But don't ever break up with me again! [  Zuko grins nervously, before they hug again.  ]",61
Katara and Sokka,Dad! [  They run to Hakoda and embrace him.  ],61
Hakoda,"I heard what you two did. I am the proudest father in the world. [  Turns to Katara.  ] And your mother would be proud, too. [  Katara sheds a few tears of joy while touching her necklace.  ]",61
Sokka,"There's my favorite warriors! I have to admit, I kind of missed the face paint. So how does it feel to be in uniform again?",61
Ty Lee,[  Appearing from behind.  ] It feels great!,61
Sokka,"[  Protects Suki and points his crutch at Ty Lee.  ] Careful, Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again.",61
Suki,"It's okay. She's one of us now. [  Sokka turns to Ty Lee before turning back to Suki, with a stunned look for both.  ]",61
Ty Lee,"Yeah, the girls and I really bonded in prison. And after a few chi-blocking lessons, they said I could join their group. We're going to be best friends forever. [  She hugs two other warriors and they all smile.  ]",61
Zuko,I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down. And now ...,61
Aang,And now we're friends.,61
Zuko,"Yeah, we  are  friends.",61
Aang,I can't believe a year ago I was still frozen in a block of ice. The world's so different now.,61
Zuko,[  Puts a hand on Aang's shoulder.  ] And it's gonna be even more different... when we build it together. [  They hug warmly and go outside.  ],61
Zuko,"Please. The real hero is the Avatar. [  Aang walks next to Zuko. Crowd cheers again. Aang turns his head slightly. Cut to side-view of Katara. The camera rotates as she smiles up at Aang proudly. Cut to overhead view of Aang and Zuko, their backs to the camera, looking out at the crowd.  ] Today this war is finally over! [  Cut briefly to Haru, Tyro, Mechanist and Teo as the crowd cheers. Cut to front view of Zuko.  ] I promised my uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation. And I will. [  Panning front view of Zuko and Aang, as seen from the crowd's perspective.  ] The road ahead of us is challenging. A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided. [  Cut to side shot of Aang, rotating around, as he turns to see Zuko smile at him, before turning back to the crowd.  ] But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the right path and begin a new era of love and peace.",61
Fire Sage,[  Puts the Fire Lord headpiece into Zuko's top knot.  ] All hail Fire Lord Zuko! [  Everyone cheers again. Zuko rises.  ],61
Ozai,[  Sarcastically.  ] I should count myself lucky. The new Fire Lord has graced me with his presence in my lowly prison cell.,61
Zuko,You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life.,61
Ozai,Hmph.,61
Zuko,Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life. It put me on the right path. Perhaps your time in here could do the same for you.,61
Ozai,Why are you really here?,61
Zuko,Because you're going to tell me something. [  Bends closer to Ozai; gravely.  ] Where is my mother?,61
Sokka,"Zuko, stop moving! I'm trying to capture the moment. I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together.",61
Katara,"That's very thoughtful of you, Sokka. [  Suddenly looks annoyed. Cuts to Sokka's painting, which is very unlike the group.  ] Wait, why did you give me Momo's ears?",61
Sokka,Those are your hair loopies!,61
Zuko,At least you don't look like a boar-q-pine! My hair is not that spiky!,61
Mai,I look like a man.,61
Suki,And why did you paint me firebending?,61
Sokka,"I thought it looked more exciting that way. [  Momo jumps on to the table and chitters.  ] Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo? [  Momo chitters again as Aang goes outside.  ]",61
Iroh,"[  Points at painting.  ] Hey, my belly's not that big anymore. I've really trimmed down.",61
Toph,Well I think you all look perfect! [  They laugh.  ],61
